"Valdevaqueros beach is very different from the beaches of Torremolinos and Marbella, which are full of hotels and concrete, but earlier in 2012 the local council in Tarifa said ‘yes’ to plans to build a tourist complex next to the beach. Environmental groups are angry. They say that the project will harm the habitats of protected animals and plants, but most of the council just want to create more jobs. 18,000 people live in Tarifa and 2,600 of them have no work. Spain is having its worst economic crisis for fifty years.","For years it has been very different from the concrete-lined beaches of Torremolinos and Marbella along the coast, but earlier in 2012 the local council in Tarifa said ‘yes’ to plans to build a tourist complex next to the beach. Environmental and conservation groups have protested that the project will harm the habitats of protected species, but for most of the council the issue is simple: jobs. Tarifa has 18,000 inhabitants and 2,600 are unemployed as Spain experiences its worst economic crisis in at least half a century.","For decades it has been a world apart from the
concrete-lined beaches of Torremolinos and
Marbella along the coast, yet on 29 May the
local council in Tarifa approved plans to build
a tourist complex right next to the beach, with
1,400 hotel rooms and 350 flats. Environmental
and conservation groups have protested that
the project will harm the habitats of protected
species, but for most councillors here the
issue is simple: jobs. In this town of 18,000
inhabitants, 2,600 are out of work as Spain

century, one that has cast doubt on the future
of the euro."
"“Traditional jobs like fishing are finishing so tourism is the only solution,” said Sebastián Galindo, a councillor from the Socialist party. Galindo says the complex does not break the law. There is a law to stop more ugly developments like those that spoilt a lot of Spain’s beaches in the 1960s and 1970s. This law says that the complex must be at least 200 metres from the coast; it will be much farther than that – it will be
800 metres.","“Traditional jobs such as fishing are dying out so tourism is the only solution, but it must be sustainable,” said Sebastián Galindo, a councillor from the Socialist party, which is in opposition in Tarifa but voted with the governing People’s Party support the project.

"Some people say more houses are not needed in Spain because the country already has a million empty houses. Galindo says it is unfair to migrant workers who came to Spain when the economy was good. Many of the workers are from Morocco, which is just 14km away, across the sea. You can see it from Tarifa.","Opponents of the complex say more housing is not needed in a country that already has a million empty homes. The Socialist opposition in Madrid attacked the idea, and Galindo said it discriminated against migrant workers who came to Spain during the boom years, many of them from Morocco, whose coastline is just 14km away and can be seen from Tarifa.","Tarifa’s Mayor, Juan Andrés Gil, declined to
comment on the project, but Galindo said
it complies with environmental standards.
The complex would be 800 metres from the
coast, comfortably beyond the minimum of
200 metres stipulated by a law designed to
prevent more ugly developments like those that
blighted much of Spain’s coastline when mass
tourism first descended on its shores in the
1960s and 1970s."
"Surfers fear that new buildings in Valdevaqueros would make the famous local wind less strong but would not attract people who want a traditional beach holiday. “It’s not really a place for families. The wind is too strong!” said Henning Mayer from Germany. “Ten years ago they said they would build a new highway here. It didn’t happen, so I think it will be impossible to build new hotels.”","Surfers fear that new buildings in Valdevaqueros would reduce the strength of the famous local wind but fail to attract traditional package holidaymakers. “It’s not really a family spot.

anyone needs is more housing in a country that

sell-off by granting non-Spaniards residency
permits in return for buying property worth at
least €160,000."

It is also a very important place for animals.","At the southernmost point of Spain, Tarifa is where Africa and Europe meet, where the Mediterranean Sea meets the Atlantic.

"Hours after the Tarifa council voted for the project, a campaign started to save the beach.

Augsburg in Germany for 20 years. “Ten years

"“They think money is more important than laws,” said Raúl Romeva, a member of the European Parliament. Romeva believes the project is wrong because the site has too little water. The town already has too little water in the hot summer weather
of Andalusía.","“Money is once again more important than urban laws and European environmental directives,” said Raúl Romeva, a member of the European Parliament.

the strategic crossroads between Africa and
Europe, where the Mediterranean Sea meets

role in the animal world as a crossroads for
migrating species."
"Many local people also want to know why they want to built a complex 10km away. They think it would be better near Tarifa’s beautiful old centre. “We agree with the complex if it creates jobs in the town,” said Cristóbal Lobato, who has worked at the same beach bar in Tarifa for 30 years. “If they put it in the centre of Tarifa, where there is space, then tourists could visit shops, bars and restaurants.”","Many locals are also wondering why a resort should be built 10km away, and not on wasteland near Tarifa’s picturesque old centre, with its typically Andalusian white walls and small streets, dominated by a 10th-century Moorish castle. “We agree with the complex as long as it creates jobs in the town, but we are against it if it only benefits a few,” said Cristóbal Lobato, who has worked at the same beachside bar in Tarifa for 30 years. “If they put it in the centre of Tarifa, where there is space, then clients could visit shops, tapas bars and restaurants.”","The campaign to save the beach was
launched hours after the Tarifa council voted
for the project. The campaign has a Facebook
page and is supported by groups including
Greenpeace, the World Wide Fund for Nature
and the Spanish branch of conservation
network Birdlife. “It’s the environmental
equivalent of putting a shopping centre right
in the middle of the Alhambra,” said Noelia
Jurado, who uses her multimedia expertise
to campaign against the complex. She also
noted that the resort would be near the ancient
Roman town of Baelo Claudia. “They could
be building on top of more Roman ruins here.
Nobody knows.”"
"Standing in the green fields where they want to build the complex, biologist Aitor Galán said, “In other countries, they would protect this place, but here they want to build lots of buildings. They want this place to become Benidorm. But what attracts people here is wild animals and the wind.”","Overlooking the green fields where the resort will be built, biologist Aitor Galán said, “Anywhere else in Europe, this place would have the utmost protection, but here they want to get rid of it all and cover it with buildings. What they want to do is turn this into Benidorm, but what attracts people here is wildlife and the wind. But by taking advantage of the current crisis and unemployment, builders and mayors who agree with them can justify any amount of destruction.”","Also joining the opposition to the planned resort
is the Andalusian College of Geographers,
which, in a preliminary study charted on its
website, concluded that “free areas”, including
car parks if not actual buildings, will overlap
part of the Alcornocales National Park. The
geographers also estimate that the site intrudes
on two wildlife conservation areas. One of the areas in Valdevaqueros is home to two species
of bat whose survival is threatened."
,,"“Money is once again being put before urban
laws and European environmental directives,”
said Raúl Romeva, a member of the European
Parliament who is Vice-President of the Greens
group. In Romeva’s view, the project is also
at fault because the proposed site has too
little water in a town that already suffers from
shortages in the summer weather that scorches
the southern Spanish region of Andalusía. Lack
of water recently led the Andalusía Supreme
Court to uphold an appeal against plans to
build a complex elsewhere in the region, which
would have included golf courses, hotels and
luxury homes. "

should be built 10km away, rather than on
wasteland near Tarifa’s picturesque old centre,

walls and winding streets, dominated by a

that of catering workers is that we agree with
the complex as long as it creates jobs in the
town, which is what is needed, but we are
against it being for the benefit of a few,” said
Cristóbal Lobato, who has worked at the same
beachside bar in Tarifa for 30 years. “If they put

building, biologist Aitor Galán, who conducts
environmental impact studies for a living,
pointed at one of only two seaside breeding
grounds for vultures in Europe. “Anywhere else
in Europe, this place would have the utmost
