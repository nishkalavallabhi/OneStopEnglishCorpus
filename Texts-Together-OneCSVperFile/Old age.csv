"“This study shows that history is important,”
said Mark Gorman, director of HelpAge
International. “The top countries are what
you would expect, but Scandinavian
countries were not rich when they introduced
pensions for everyone. Older people in Sri
Lanka today have good basic education and
health care – those countries decided to
help older people. No country has enough
money but, when they decide how to
spend their money, they should not forget
older people.”","“This survey shows that history counts,”

"The study includes 91 countries and 89% of
the world’s older people. The study comes at
a time of big population changes: by 2050,
there will probably be two billion people
aged 60 and over, which will be more than a
fifth of the world’s population.","The index, developed with the UN Fund for
Population and Development, covers 91

"Population ageing – when older people
are a larger and larger percentage of
the population – is happening fastest in
developing countries. More than two-thirds
of older people live in poor countries; by
2050, this proportion will probably be about
four-fifths. The fastest ageing countries
– Jordan, Laos, Mongolia, Nicaragua
and Vietnam – are in the lower half of the
ranking, which suggests that politicians
there need to look at the problem of ageing
so that they can give enough support to
their populations. There are also differences
between men and women in ageing
populations – women generally live longer
than men. In 2012, for every 84 men aged
60 and over, there were 100 women.","Population ageing – when older people form

"However, population ageing does not always
mean more health care spending, according
to the report, which shows the importance
of long-term investments in education and
health care for older people. Bolivia, ranked
46, is one of the poorest countries but it has
introduced good policies for older people – a
national plan on ageing, free health care and
a pension for everyone.","There are gender differences among ageing
populations, with women generally living
longer than men. In 2012, for every 84 men
aged 60 and over, there were 100 women.
Many women face disadvantages in old age
because of lack of paid work (and therefore
also savings), less decision-making power in
the family and the fact that they are vulnerable
to violence.","The index shows that the fastest ageing
countries – Jordan, Laos, Mongolia, Nicaragua
and Vietnam, where the number of older people
is predicted to more than triple by 2050 – fall
into the lower half of the ranking, suggesting that
policymakers need to tackle ageing head-on if
they are to adequately support their populations."
"Chile and Costa Rica introduced good basic
health care many years ago and this has
helped the ageing populations of those
countries. A good education system is very
useful later in life – basic literacy is very
important for older people when they have
to read and complete pensions documents.
In the Philippines, the educational reforms
introduced after independence in 1946 have
helped older people – elementary and high
school education became compulsory. The
same is true for Armenia, which, like other
countries of the ex-Soviet Union, had a
strong education system. South Korea is a
surprisingly low 67 in the ageing study, partly
because it introduced a pension
only recently.","However, population ageing does not

"It is clear that countries all over the
world should do more to help their
ageing populations.","Good basic health care introduced decades
ago in Chile and Costa Rica has helped
the ageing populations of those countries.

a non-contributory universal pension. Nepal,
ranked 77, introduced a basic pension in 1995
for people over the age of 70 without other
pension income. Though limited in value and
eligibility and with uneven coverage, it is an
example of how a poor country has chosen to
make a start in addressing poverty in old age."
,"The ageing index is calculated using 13
indicators under four headings: income
security, health care, employment and
education, and a positive environment. All
indicators have equal weight, except for
pension income coverage, life expectancy
at 60, healthy life expectancy at 60 and
psychological well-being. These categories
have increased importance because of better
data quality and countries were included only if
there was enough data.","Good basic health care introduced decades ago
