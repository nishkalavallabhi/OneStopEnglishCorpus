"Joseph Roche is on the shortlist of astronauts for
Mars One, a private mission that plans to send
humans to live on Mars from 2025. He is on the
shortlist but he is sceptical about Mars One.","He is not the first person to express scepticism
about Mars One, a private mission that aims to

Joseph Roche is different from most critics: he’s
on the shortlist of astronauts.","He is not the first person to express scepticism
about Mars One, a vastly ambitious private
mission aiming to settle humans on Mars from

"Roche is an astrophysicist at Trinity College
Dublin. He is one of the 100 people on the
shortlist for the mission. He has doubts about
Mars One.","Roche, an astrophysicist at Trinity College Dublin
who was announced in February as one of the
100 people shortlisted for the mission, has written
for the Guardian expressing his doubts about the
viability of Mars One.","Roche, an astrophysicist at Trinity College Dublin

"The selection process, Roche says, did not
“reach the standard of more traditional astronaut
selection processes”. He also says the Dutch
Mars One team are naive because they believe
they can succeed alone in the $6 billion mission.
He says they should now accept it will probably
not happen.","The selection process, Roche writes, “was not
rigorous enough to reach the standard of more
traditional astronaut selection programmes”. He
also says the Dutch Mars One team have shown
“a certain naivety” because they believe they can
succeed alone in the $6bn mission. He says they
should now accept it is very unlikely to happen.","The selection process, Roche writes, “was

"The group plans to send a lander and satellite
to Mars in 2018, followed by a rover in 2020 and
cargo missions starting in 2022. Humans will start
arriving in 2025 and they will send more crews of
four people every two years. The astronauts will
not return to Earth.","Roche also expressed worries about the way
the mission organizers publicized a ‘top-ten’ list
of candidates. The ranking, he said, didn’t mean
these were the best astronauts. It was based on
how many “supporter points” each had earned.","He writes: “More openness and transparency
would benefit Mars One greatly but I think that
the shortcomings of the selection process,
coupled with their unwillingness to engage and
collaborate with the scientific community mean
that the time might have come for Mars One to
acknowledge the implausibility of this particular
venture and turn their efforts towards supporting
other exciting and more viable upcoming
space missions.”"
"Gerard ’t Hooft is a Dutch Nobel laureate in
physics. He is a supporter of the project but he
says he does not believe the Mars One plans are
realistic. He said: “It will take longer and be more
expensive. When they asked me to be involved, I
told them: ‘You have to put a zero
after everything’.”","He says that these points only show how much
each supporter has donated to Mars One, for
example by buying official merchandise.","Roche also expressed worries about the way the
mission organizers publicized a so-called top-ten

these were the most likely potential astronauts
but was, instead, based on how many “supporter

buying official merchandise."
"Roche also said that there were not 200,000
people who applied to be astronauts, as Mars
One said; there were only 2,761.","The official timeline for the mission says the
group plans to send a stationary lander and
satellite to Mars in 2018, followed by a rover
in 2020 and cargo missions starting in 2022.
Humans would start arriving in 2025 and crews of
four would be sent every two years to add to the
settlement. They would not return to Earth.","He writes: “These points are Mars One’s
supporter points which ‘represent the degree
of your support to Mars One’s mission’.” These
points play no role in the selection process and serve only to show how much each supporter has
donated to Mars One.”"
"He talked about the selection process in more
detail: “I have not met anyone from Mars One. At
first, they said there would be regional interviews;
we would travel there, and they would interview
and test us over several days. To me, that
sounded like a proper astronaut
selection process.","In February, a supporter of the project, Gerard
’t Hooft, a Dutch Nobel laureate in physics, said
he did not believe this timetable was realistic. He
said: “It will take quite a bit longer and be quite a
bit more expensive. When they first asked me to
be involved, I told them: ‘You have to put a zero
after everything’.”","The official timeline for the mission says the

"“But it changed from a proper regional interview
over several days to a ten-minute Skype call.”","Roche also said that there were not 200,000

"Roche says he does not want to give more
interviews because he doesn’t want to sound
negative about space travel.","He talked about the selection process in more
detail: “I have not met anyone from Mars One
in person. Initially, there were going to be
regional interviews; we would travel there, we’d
be interviewed and we’d be tested over several

astronaut selection process.","Roche also spoke to Medium, a US blogging
platform that has previously expressed grave
sceptism about Mars One, reporting among other
things that the supposed 200,000 applications to
be astronauts in fact totalled 2,761."
"He said that being involved in the public
debate about future missions is one of the
most interesting and enjoyable things about his
connection with Mars One. He then said that, “If a
one-way mission to Mars ever became possible,
I would always volunteer. For an astrophysicist,
that is not a difficult decision to make.” But he
does not think there will be a one-way mission in
his lifetime.","“But, all of a sudden, it changed from being a
proper regional interview over several days to

One in person. Initially, they’d said there were
going to be regional interviews; we would travel

least like something that approached a legitimate
astronaut selection process."
,"Roche told the Guardian that he did not want to
give more interviews because he didn’t want to
sound negative about the idea of space travel.","“But then they made us sign a non-disclosure
agreement if we wanted to be interviewed and
then, all of a sudden, it changed from being a
proper regional interview over several days to

,"He writes: “I am passionate about scientific
endeavour and that is why the ambitiousness of
the Mars One plan appealed to me. Mars One
were never likely to overcome the financial and
technical barriers during their proposed timeline.
But it was nice to hear a new idea that challenges
us to think about our own role in the future of
space exploration.","Roche told the Guardian he did not want to give
more interviews as he was wary about being

,,"“Being part of the subsequent public debate over
the ethics and morality of future missions has been one of the most interesting and enjoyable
aspects of my candidacy with Mars One. If a
one-way mission to Mars ever became

think we will see a one-way mission in
my lifetime.”"
