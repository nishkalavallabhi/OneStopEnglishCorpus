"I arrived in the Mexican capital after a bus
journey all the way from New York. In my
new job, I spent my days on the streets in
political rallies and my nights alone in the
offi ce, where I coordinated the news from
areas of fi ghting in El Salvador, Nicaragua,
Guatemala and the rest of Central America.
But, I also had to report on disasters: fi res,
fl oods and explosions at fi rework factories.","I had just arrived in the Mexican capital

"While I was working as a reporter, I found
out that I was bad at understanding numbers
in Spanish. Once, when I wanted to phone
the police, I got a Mexican grandmother out
of bed at 2am because I had misunderstood
a phone number. Even worse, there were
too many victims in my stories – 83 dead
in a fi re at 6pm become 38 dead by 7pm;
12 people injured in a coach crash soon
became two and so it went on. Finally, I got
a call from the main offi ce in Washington.
“I don’t know what training you have had,”
an editor shouted, “but has no one ever told
you a death toll can’t go down?!”","It was as a reporter that I soon found out

a number and dialled a wrong digit. Even

"Why are numbers in another language such
a problem? Perhaps it is because of different
numbering systems. In German, for example,
2.30pm is halb drei (half of three) and 21 is
einundzwanzig (one and twenty). Different
number systems can clearly cause confusion.","Why are numbers in another language such

"Some experts believe there is a link
between dyscalculia – the diffi culty in
understanding arithmetic – and problems
learning foreign languages, particularly if
you learn languages by rote. But, some
students who fi nd it hard to learn languages
with a grammar textbook may learn more
easily in a foreign country, where learning
is more natural. In my case, I have always
found languages quite easy, apart from
the numbers.","Some experts believe there is a link between

"But, perhaps it’s also because we often
hear numbers in a non-native language out
of context. You may stop listening to the
foreign language and suddenly be unable to
understand. I talked to multilingual friends
and they said that they are fl uent in French
or Italian when ordering from a restaurant
menu, for example, but freeze if they have
to say numbers, especially over the phone.

could say why.","But, perhaps it’s also because you often

"One night, a Mexican colleague told me
that a gunman was holding the American
consul hostage in his offi ce in the port city of
Veracruz. There was no senior
English-speaking reporter in the offi ce, so
they asked me to try to call the consulate. I
got the phone number wrong and I was put
through to another phone somewhere else
in the building. I knew straight away who the
person was: I talked for 15 minutes to the
gunman. He didn’t put away his gun as a
result of his conversation with me – but my
reputation as a reporter rose instantly.","One night, a Mexican colleague learnt
