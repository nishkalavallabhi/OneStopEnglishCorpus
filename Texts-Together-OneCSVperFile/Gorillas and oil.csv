"Rare mountain gorillas live in the Virunga

could earn $400 million a year from tourism,
hydropower and carbon credits, said a WWF
report. But a British company want to look
for oil there.","The Virunga National Park is home to rare

"If they look for oil at the UNESCO World
Heritage Site that crosses the equator, as
the Congolese government and exploration
firm SOCO International hope, it could lead
to terrible pollution and conflict, says
the WWF.","But if the UNESCO World Heritage Site that
crosses the equator is exploited for oil, as

conflict in the region, says the WWF.","But, if the UNESCO World Heritage Site that
straddles the equator is exploited for oil, as the
Congolese government and exploration firm

"SOCO say that they would look for oil in a
part of the park called Block V, and that their
work would not affect the gorillas.","SOCO International is the only company
that wants to explore inside the boundaries
of the Virunga park. SOCO insist that their
operations in Congo would be kept to an

would not affect the gorillas.","SOCO International is the only company seeking

"SOCO Chairman Rui de Sousa said that
SOCO knows about the environmental
importance of the Virunga National Park. He
also said that oil companies have a central
role in today’s global energy supply and that
a successful oil project could help a
whole country.","SOCO Chairman Rui de Sousa said:
“Despite the views of WWF, SOCO is
extremely sensitive to the environmental
significance of the Virunga National Park. Oil
companies still have a central role in today’s
global energy supply and a successful oil
project has the potential to transform the
economic and social well-being of a
whole country.’’","SOCO Chairman Rui de Sousa said: “Despite

well-being of a whole country.’’"
"But Raymond Lumbuenamo, country
director for WWF Democratic Republic of
the Congo, based in Kinshassa, said that
security in and around the park would get
worse if SOCO started looking for oil.","However, Raymond Lumbuenamo, country
director for WWF Democratic Republic

that security in and around the park would
get worse if SOCO went ahead with its
exploration plans.","He added: “The park has sadly been in decline
for many years, officially falling below the
standards required for a World Heritage Site.
The potential for development just might be the
catalyst that reverses this trend.’’"
"“Security is already bad. The UN is involved
with fighting units and the M23 rebel force
is inside the park. Oil would be a curse. It
always makes conflict worse. The park might
become like the Niger Delta. Developing
Virunga for oil will not make anything better.”","“The security situation is already bad. The

"Many people live in the park – over 350
people per square kilometre. Oil would not
create many jobs, and many more
people would come looking for work,
Lumbuenamo said.","“The population there is already very dense,
with over 350 people per square kilometre.
When you take part of the land (for oil), you
put more pressure on the rest. Oil would not
provide many jobs; people would flood in
looking for work,” he said.","“The security situation is already bad. The UN
is involved with fighting units and the M23 rebel
force is inside the park. Oil would be a curse. It

sabotage. The park might become like the Niger

anything better."
"One danger is that another eruption of one
of the volcanoes in the park could damage
oil company buildings and machines and
lead to oil spills in the lakes. “Virunga’s rich
natural resources are for the Congolese
people, not for foreign oil companies,”
Lumbuenamo said.","One fear is that the area is seismically active
and another eruption of one of the volcanoes
in the park could damage oil company
infrastructure and lead to oil spills in the
lakes. “Virunga’s rich natural resources are
for the benefit of the Congolese people, not
for foreign oil prospectors. Our country’s
future depends on sustainable economic
development,” said Lumbuenamo.","“The population there is already very dense, with

"But Raymond accepted that, although the
gorillas were safe now, the park would
probably not be able to make $400 million.
“It would be difficult to make the kind of
money that the report talks of.”","“For me, choosing the conservation option
is the best option. Once you have started
drilling for oil, there’s no turning back,”
he said.","One fear is that the area is seismically active and

"The WWF report says that ecosystems
in the park could support fishing and
ecotourism, and play an important role in
providing water and stopping soil erosion.","But Lumbuenamo accepted that, while the
gorillas were safe now, the chances of the
park making $400m a year were small. “It

"The park is Africa’s oldest and most diverse.
It is home to over 3,000 different kinds of
animals. “Virunga is a valuable asset to DR
Congo,” the report says. “Plans to look for oil
put Virunga’s future in danger,” it says.","According to the WWF report, ecosystems

generation, fishing and ecotourism, and play

animals, but is now heavily populated with
desperately poor people, many of whom
went there after the Rwanda massacre

permanent jobs. In addition, people around

managed and is safe for future generations,”

not rest until Virunga is safe from this potential
environmental disaster,” said Lasse Gustavsson,
executive director of WWF International. “Virunga
has snow fields and lava fields, but it should not
have oil fields.”"
,,"The UNESCO World Heritage Committee called
for the cancellation of all Virunga oil permits
and appealed to concession holders Total SA
and SOCO International plc not to undertake
exploration in World Heritage Sites. Total has
committed to respecting Virunga’s current
boundary, leaving UK-based SOCO as the only
oil company with plans to explore inside the park."
