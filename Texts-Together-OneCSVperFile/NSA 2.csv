"The US Senate Intelligence Committee
recently agreed a bill to allow the National
Security Agency (NSA) to continue to collect
US phone records. But it would also make
the NSA’s activities more transparent. The
committee Chairwoman, Dianne Feinstein,
introduced the bill. It allows the NSA to
continue to collect the telephone metadata
of millions of Americans. It also allows the
government to keep the data. Eleven people
voted for the bill and four people voted
against it. The full Senate will now vote on
the bill.","The US Senate Intelligence Committee has

bulk collection of US phone records but allow the
controversial practice to continue. Sponsored
by Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, the bill lets
the NSA continue to collect phone metadata
of millions of Americans for renewable 90-day
periods and allows the government to retain it.
Some legislators have alternatively proposed
letting phone companies hold the metadata. It
passed the committee by an 11-4 vote, paving
the way for a full Senate vote."
"The bill allows analysts to search through
the data if they believe that someone may
be involved in international terrorism. The
bill also allows the NSA to continue to watch
foreigners who come to the US if they enter
the country for less than 72 hours.","The bill allows analysts to search through
the data if they think there is a ‘reasonable
suspicion’ that someone is associated with
international terrorism. The bill also allows the
NSA to continue surveillance that is begun
on foreigners outside the US if they enter the
country, for a period of up to 72 hours.","The bill allows analysts to search through the

the NSA to continue surveillance begun on
foreigners outside the US if they enter the country
‘for a transitory period not to exceed 72 hours’."
"Senator Patrick Leahy introduced another
bill (the USA Freedom Act). This bill would
stop the collection of phone records in the
US. Feinstein defended the NSA phone data
collection programme, but said that people
didn’t trust the NSA anymore. “The NSA
programme is legal and I believe it makes
us safer,” she said. “But we can, and should,
do more to increase transparency and build
public support for privacy protections.”","The bill is a direct challenge to another bill
introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy that
would end domestic phone-records collection.
It was also opposed by leading Intelligence
Committee member Mark Udall, who said it
did not go far enough. “The NSA’s surveillance
of Americans’ private information does not
respect our constitutional values and needs
fundamental reform,” Udall said.","The bill is a direct challenge to one introduced by

information does not respect our constitutional
values and needs fundamental reform, not
incidental changes. Unfortunately, the bill passed
by the Senate Intelligence Committee does not
go far enough to address the NSA’s overreaching
domestic surveillance programmes,” Udall said."
"Feinstein said the bill would also make a
number of improvements to transparency
and checks on the NSA – for example, if the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)
gets some data and then somebody looks
at that data without permission, they could
spend up to ten years in prison.","Feinstein defended the NSA bulk collection
programme, but said there was a need to
rebuild public trust. “The NSA call-records
programme is legal, and I believe it contributes
to our national security,” she said in a
statement. “But more can, and should, be
done to increase transparency and build public
support for privacy protections in place.”","Another Democratic member of the committee,
Ron Wyden, said the bill maintains “business as
usual” and “remains far from anything that could
be considered meaningful reform”. Feinstein
defended the NSA bulk collection programme, but
said there was a need to rebuild public trust. “The
NSA call-records programme is legal and subject
to extensive congressional and judicial oversight,
and I believe it contributes to our national
security,” she said in a statement. “But more can,
and should, be done to increase transparency and
build public support for privacy protections in place.”"
"Feinstein says she strongly supports the
NSA’s main US programme. “I think many
people don’t understand this NSA database
programme. It is very important and helps to
protect this country,” she said.","Feinstein said the bill would also make a
number of improvements to transparency and
checks on the NSA – for example, someone
who accesses data acquired under the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) by the
United States without permission could spend
up to ten years in prison. There would also be
a limit on the number of contacts an analyst
can receive in response to a request for bulk
communication records.","In her statement, Feinstein said the bill would
also make a number of improvements to
transparency and oversight on the
NSA, including:
• requiring an annual public report of the
total number of queries of NSA’s telephone
metadata database and the number of times
the programme leads to an FBI investigation or
probable cause order;
• requiring that the foreign intelligence surveillance
court impose limits on the number of people at
NSA who may authorize or query the
call-records database;
• establishing criminal penalties of up to ten years
in prison for intentional unauthorized access to
data acquired under the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act (FISA) by the United States;
• mandating the FISA court impose a limit on the
number of contacts an analyst can
receive in response to a query of bulk
communication records."
"Independent legal experts said they were
worried about the Intelligence Committee’s
bill. Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center
for Justice said: “The Intelligence Committee
bill and the USA Freedom Act are two
opposing visions of the relationship between
Americans who do not break the law and the
national security state. The most important
question is: should the government have
some reason to suspect wrongdoing
before collecting Americans’ most personal
information? Leahy says yes; Feinstein
says no.”","After the committee’s hearing had ended,
Feinstein strongly supported the NSA’s main
domestic programme. “I think there’s huge
misunderstanding about this NSA database
programme, and how vital it is to protecting this
country,” she said.","After the committee’s hearing had ended,

"Democratic committee member Ron Wyden
said that recent worries about NSA spying
on foreign leaders took attention away from
the more important problem of the NSA
checking the data of people in the US. “My
top priority is ending the collection of data on
millions and millions of innocent Americans.”","Concern over the Intelligence Committee’s bill
was expressed by independent legal experts.
Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for
Justice said: “The Intelligence Committee
bill and the USA Freedom Act present two
opposing visions of the relationship between
law-abiding Americans and the national security
state. The fundamental question is: should
the government have some reason to suspect
wrongdoing before collecting Americans’ most
personal information to feed into its databases?
Leahy says yes; Feinstein says no.”","Concern over the Intelligence Committee’s bill
was expressed by independent legal experts,
who said the stage was now set for a showdown
with the USA Freedom Act, a bill introduced
by Leahy and Jim Sensenbrenner that would
prohibit bulk collection of Americans’ telephone
records. Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center
for Justice said: “The Intelligence Committee bill
and the USA Freedom Act present two opposing
visions of the relationship between law-abiding

Sensenbrenner say yes; Feinstein says no.”"
"Feinstein said that she completely disagreed
with the foreign leader spying that the NSA
does, for example on German Chancellor
Angela Merkel. But Feinstein agrees with
the NSA’s collection of Americans’
phone records.","Democratic committee member Ron Wyden
suggested that recent concern about NSA
spying on foreign leaders had taken attention
away from the real focus on mass surveillance
in the US. “The statements that American
intelligence officials have made about collecting
data from foreign leaders is consistent with the
understanding I’ve had for years, as a member
of the Intelligence Committee,” he said. “That
has implications for foreign policy. My top
priority is ending the mass surveillance, digital
surveillance, on millions and millions of lawabiding
Americans.”","Wyden suggested that recent concern about NSA

“That has implications for foreign policy. My top
priority is ending the mass surveillance, digital

"“Americans are making it clear, that they
never – repeat, never – agreed to give up
their freedom so that the country could
appear to be safer,” Wyden said. “We’re
just going to continue to fight this battle. It’s
going to be a long battle.”","To everyone’s surprise, Feinstein announced
that she was “totally opposed” to the foreign
leader spying of the sort the NSA conducts on
German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Feinstein
has been a strong supporter of the NSA’s bulk
collection of Americans’ phone records.","Feinstein unexpectedly announced that she

,"Feinstein’s strong support for domestic phone
records collection shows that she is not yet
ready to expand the criticism of the NSA
that she gave when she “totally opposed” its
surveillance of foreign allied leaders – a more
traditional intelligence activity than bulk phone
metadata surveillance.","Separately, Feinstein said that James Clapper,
the Director of National Intelligence, had agreed
to provide her in writing with a statement about
a Washington Post story that alleged the NSA
had intercepted data in transmission between
Google and Yahoo data centres. She said she
was withholding judgement on the story until she
saw Clapper’s rebuttal. Her strong endorsement
of the domestic phone records collection
indicates that the powerful Senate Democrat is
not yet prepared to expand the criticism of the
NSA that she has launched, “totally opposing”
its surveillance of foreign allied leaders – a more
traditional intelligence activity than bulk phone
metadata surveillance."
,"“Decades ago, countries had their own kinds of
communication systems. Now that you’ve had the merger of global communications, I think
you’re going to have a lot more challenges
spying on foreigners with implications for US
citizens,” Wyden said.","Wyden would not comment on the Washington
Post report on the Google and Yahoo intercepts.
But the senators suggested it had implications
for the privacy of Americans’ communication.
“Decades ago, countries had their own kinds of
