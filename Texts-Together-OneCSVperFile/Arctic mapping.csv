"Google has made maps of the world’s
highest mountains, the ocean floor, the
Amazon rainforest and even shown us a bit
of North Korea. They want to make maps
of the whole world, but they have mostly
stayed away from the Arctic.","It has mapped the world’s highest peaks, the

"Now, however, Google is starting a very
important update to hundreds of years of
polar map making – and it hopes that the
map will help give a better understanding
of life on the permafrost for millions of web
users. A small Google team has flown to
Iqaluit, the largest town in the Canadian
territory of Nunavut. They have taken
their warmest winter clothes, many laptop
computers and an 18kg telescopic camera
that they can fix to their backpacks.","Now, however, Google is starting what might

"When Google made maps of other parts
of the world it used a special camera on a
car roof. In Iqaluit that was not possible, so
Google’s map makers walked the town’s
snowy roads and trails. Some roads are
made of ice and disappear in the short
summer months.","Unlike more accessible parts of the world,
which have been mapped using a special
camera on a car roof, for Google’s Iqaluit
project mappers walked the town’s snowpacked
roads and crossed little-known
trails, some of which are made of ice and
disappear in the short summer months.","Aaron Brindle, project leader, said: “I live in
Toronto and I absolutely take for granted that
everything is where it should be and that this
map is kind of my world, but for so long that
hasn’t been the case in the north.”"
"The team also walked along part of a 15km
road known as the Road to Nowhere,
despite warnings about meeting polar bears.","The team also walked along part of a 15km
dead-end road known as the Road to

of the world, which have been mapped using
a special camera mounted on a car roof, the
Iqaluit project had mappers hiking the town’s
snow-packed roads and traversing little-known
trails, some of which are made of ice and
disappear in the brief summer months."
"The online map that Google had already
created using satellite images was mostly
correct, but one road was missing that had
been built in the last year.","John Graham, mayor of Iqaluit, understands
the enthusiasm of the locals who followed
Google’s digital map makers while they
worked. The Street View project, he said,
follows in the footsteps of the English
explorer Martin Frobisher, who in 1576
sailed into the bay where Iqaluit now is while
searching for the Northwest Passage, and
the 1941 flight of Captain Elliott Roosevelt,
an officer and son of the US President,
which led to the site being chosen for a
military airbase. His exploration led to the
founding of the modern town of Iqaluit.","The team also cut a path along part of a 15km
cul-de-sac known as the Road to Nowhere,
despite warnings about the risk from polar
bears and other wildlife."
"One difficulty was how to place on the map
many businesses and homes that have mail
sent to the local post office and not delivered
to their address. Putting the PO box
addresses on the map would mean the new
map would show all the companies, banks
and schools in the same place, around the
Canada Post building in the centre of town.","What Google had already created on their
existing map using satellite images was
quite accurate, but they were missing one
road that had been created in the past year.","Mayor John Graham said the digital
cartographers were, however, hunted by a herd
of excited and curious locals, or Google stalkers."
"About 30 Inuit elders, business people and
high-school pupils helped Google to correct
this problem. They were given a laptop
computer and told how to make sure their
homes, shops and meeting places would
show up correctly on the map.","One difficulty was how to situate many

airbase. His exploration led to the founding
of the modern town of Iqaluit, which is the
seat of government as well as a transport and
communications hub for Nunavut."
"The project is more than a novelty. Arif
Sayani, the town’s Director of Planning,
said that people who are thinking of visiting
or moving to the area would be able to use
the maps to see the area. It may also help
planning decisions in Iqaluit happen
more quickly.","About 30 Inuit elders, business people and
high-school pupils came one night to help
correct such problems. They were provided
with a laptop computer and shown how to
make sure their homes, shops and meeting
places would show up accurately on
the map.","One of the initial challenges Google faced was
gathering the raw data needed to fill in their
existing map. What they had created using
satellite images was fairly accurate, although
the rapid pace of the town’s growth, which has
been fuelled by a mining boom, meant they
were missing one road that had been created
in the past year, said Arif Sayani, the town’s
Director of Planning."
"The project leader for Google said he
hoped to see the work continue in other
northern towns. But moving people and
equipment around the vast Arctic territory
is very expensive. So, in the future, Google
might send equipment to the area and ask
volunteers to complete the map.","The project is more than a novelty. Arif
Sayani, the town’s Director of Planning, said
the town would be able to use the maps as a
promotional tool for those thinking of visiting

businesses and homeowners that have
mail sent to the local post office rather than
delivered to their address. Plotting the PO
box addresses would result in a map with
firms, banks and schools clustered around the
Canada Post building in the centre of town."
,"The project leader for Google said he hoped
to see the work continue in other northern
towns. However, the high costs of moving
people and equipment around the vast
Arctic territory means they might have to use
cheaper methods in the future, for example,
sending equipment to the area and asking
volunteers to complete the map.","About 30 Inuit elders, entrepreneurs and
high-school pupils turned out one night to help
correct such problems. They were provided

philanthropy. Sayani, 32, said the town would
be able to use the maps as a promotional tool
for those thinking of visiting or moving to the
area. It may also speed up planning decisions
that will affect Iqaluit’s growth."
,,"The test run for the Iqaluit mapping exercise
occurred last summer in Cambridge Bay, a
much smaller Nunavut town of about 1,500
people located 1,700km and a time zone west
of Iqaluit."
,,"The gravel roads and muddy puddles that can
now be seen online, however, give little sense of life in a land usually covered in snow, which
is one reason why Google selected the lesshospitable
month of March to travel to Iqaluit."
,,"Brindle said he hoped to see the work continue
in other northern towns, though the high costs
of shipping and airfares to move people and
equipment around the vast Arctic territory
appears to be weighing on Google’s ambitions."
,,"The next northern site has not yet been
identified but, when it is selected, Brindle said
the company might simply send one of its
hi-tech backpacks and rely on volunteers to
literally put themselves on the map."
,,"“I’m hoping that three, four, five years from
now we’ll look back and see a very different
map of Canada’s north,” Brindle added."
