"The Chief Medical Officer for England
compared the problem of antibiotic
resistance to the risks of international
terrorism. But, each year, the number of
deaths around the world from bacterial
resistance is far more than the number of
deaths from terrorist attacks.","The Chief Medical Officer for England has
compared the problem of antibiotic resistance
to the risks of international terrorism. But, in
fact, each year the global number of deaths
caused by bacterial resistance is far
more than the number of deaths caused by
terrorist attacks.","Dame Sally Davies, the Chief Medical Officer
for England, has likened the problem of
antibiotic resistance to the risks presented by
international terrorism. While this might sound
like an exaggeration, the threat was actually,
if anything, understated. Each year, the global
number of deaths to which bacterial resistance
contributes far outstrips those caused by
terrorist attacks."
"The World Health Organization says that
each year more than 150,000 people die
from tuberculosis because of antibiotic
resistance. This is now a war.","The World Health Organization estimates that,
just for tuberculosis, multi-drug resistance kills
more than 150,000 people each year. Antibiotic
resistance is now a real risk: this is now a war.","While it is difficult to track the global impact
of antibiotic resistance across all bacterial
species, the World Health Organization
estimates that for tuberculosis alone multi-drug
resistance accounts for more than 150,000
deaths each year. Antibiotic resistance is no
longer an abstract risk: this is now a war."
"A hundred years ago, life expectancy in
the UK was about 47 years for a man
and 50 years for a woman. Lots of young
children died. About 30% of all deaths were
in children under the age of five, mostly
because of infectious disease.","In the past hundred years, our expectations
of life and survival have changed beyond all
recognition. At the beginning of the twentieth
century, life expectancy in the UK was around
47 years of age for a man and 50 for a woman,
a number heavily affected by the very high rate
of infant mortality in those days. Around a third
of all deaths were in children under the age of
five, mostly because of infectious disease.","In the past hundred years, our expectations

"But a child born in Britain today has more
than a 25% chance of reaching their 100th
birthday. We can thank public health
systems, vaccination and antibiotics for this.","However, a child born in Britain today has
more than a one in four chance of reaching
their 100th birthday. For this we have public
health systems, vaccination and antibiotics
to thank. It is thanks to this – the prevention
and treatment of illnesses caused by
microorganisms – that the real war against
disease is mainly won.","In contrast, a child born in Britain today has
a better than one in four chance of reaching
their 100th birthday. For this we have public
health systems, vaccination and antibiotics to

microorganisms – that the real war against
disease is principally won."
"In intensive care, antibiotic resistant bacteria
are most common. Here, powerful antibiotics
are used very often. These drugs kill
ordinary bacteria. But they cannot kill strong
bacteria that have begun to learn how to
survive antibiotic drugs.","It is in intensive care, my specialist area,
that antibiotic resistant organisms are most
common. Here, powerful antibiotics, essential
in the treatment of life-threatening illness,
are used routinely. These drugs kill ordinary
bacteria. But they leave behind strong bacteria
that have begun to learn how to survive
antibiotic drugs.","Elsewhere, we have pushed the limits of
survival, notably in intensive care. This,
the specialism in which I chose to train, is
where antibiotic resistant organisms are most
prevalent. Here, powerful antibiotics, essential
in the treatment of life-threatening illness, are
used routinely. These drugs decimate ordinary
bacteria. But what they leave behind are hardy
species that have begun to learn tricks that
allow them to evade antibiotic drugs."
"When I became a doctor in the 1990s,
I learnt about Methicillin Resistant
Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) is a
bacteria that is resistant to methicillin and all
other penicillins. There were just a few drugs
that could kill it – for example, vancomycin
and teicoplanin. But antibiotic resistant
bacteria became more and more common.","As a newly qualified doctor in the late
1990s, I learnt about Methicillin Resistant
Staphylococcus Aureus – the infamous MRSA
– a bacterial species resistant to methicillin and
all other penicillins. In the fight against it, there
were a small number of drugs, like vancomycin
and teicoplanin. These were supposed to be
our defence, but antibiotic resistant bacteria
became more and more common; bacteria
with new kinds of resistance became more
common too. Drugs we had previously hardly
heard of became common. We got used to
this; a slow increase in the arms race between
us and the bacteria.","As a newly qualified doctor in the late
1990s, I learnt about Methicillin Resistant
Staphylococcus Aureus – the infamous MRSA
– a bacterial species resistant to methicillin
and all other penicillins. In the fight against it,
there were a handful of exotic-sounding drugs
– vancomycin and teicoplanin among them.
These were supposed to be our last lines
of defence, but antibiotic resistant bacteria
became more and more common; as did
species with new patterns of resistance. Drugs
we had previously barely heard of became
commonplace. New last-line drugs emerged
to replace the old. We got used to this state of
affairs; a steady escalation in the arms race
between us and the bacteria."
"In our hospitals and our doctor’s surgeries
we use antiobiotics too often.","But the balance has been slowly moving. In
our hospitals and our GP surgeries, we have
abused the drugs that gave us such a huge
advantage over infectious disease – we use
them too often. And some of the worst abuses
have happened outside of healthcare, with
antibiotics introduced into the food chain,
through agriculture and by putting antibacterial
drugs into food for farm animals.
We thought that antibiotic therapy was an
advantage we could enjoy forever. We became
complacent that the pharmaceutical industry
would continue to stay ahead of the game.","But the balance has been shifting steadily. In
our hospitals and our GP surgeries we have
abused the drugs that gave us such a huge
advantage over infectious disease, using them
too often and too indiscriminately. And some
of the worst abuses have occurred outside of
healthcare, with antibiotics introduced into the
food chain, through agriculture and the lacing
of livestock feed with anti-bacterial drugs.
We assumed that antibiotic therapy was an
advantage we could enjoy forever. We became
complacent that the pharmaceutical industry
would continue to stay ahead of
the game."
"Also, we have put antibiotics into the food
chain, when we grow food and when we put
anti-bacterial drugs into food for farm animals.","But this is no longer the case. New, more
resistant species have been found. The
vancomycin that we used to treat MRSA
infection no longer worked. Vancomycin
Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (VRSA)
appeared in our hospitals. And other bacteria
were learning resistance. Enterobacteria
also became resistant to vancomycin. Today,
infections with highly resistant organisms are
common and the pharmaceutical industry is
not keeping up. Fewer and fewer new antimicrobial
drugs are produced. It is becoming
more and more difficult to develop new drugs
that work against resistant bacteria. For
every method of attack the pharmaceutical
companies invent, bacteria quickly form
a defence. We have tried all of the simple
approaches to the problem. Antibiotics have
become drugs that are expensive to develop,
that are only used in short courses and that
quickly become ineffective due to the changes
in bacterial resistance. As a result, the
pharmaceutical industry’s incentive to create
new drugs that can fight them is low.","But this is no longer the case. New, more
resistant species have been identified. The
vancomycin that we used to rely on to treat
MRSA infection was defeated. Vancomycin
Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (VRSA)
emerged in our hospitals. And other bacterial
species were learning the same trick.
Enterobacteria, organisms usually found in the
gut, had also acquired vancomycin resistance.
Today, infections with formidable, highly
resistant organisms are commonplace and the
pharmaceutical industry is not keeping pace.
Fewer and fewer new anti-microbial drugs
are emerging from their production lines. It
is becoming increasingly difficult to develop
new drugs active against resistant strains. For
every method of attack the pharmaceutical
companies invent, bacteria rapidly evolve a
defence. All of the simple approaches to the
problem have been exhausted. Antibiotics have become drugs that are expensive to
develop, that are only used in short courses
and that quickly become ineffective due to the
evolution of bacterial resistance. Consequently,
the pharmaceutical industry’s incentive to
manufacture new drugs that can fight them
is low."
"We thought that antibiotics were something
we could use forever. We thought that
companies would continue to make more
and more antibiotics.","Antibiotics became common in the 1940s, and
almost straight away we saw the first evidence
of bacteria resistance. Today, this has become
a normal part of medical life. Less than a
century after the discovery of penicillin, we are
beginning to lose the fight.","Almost as soon as antibiotic use became
widespread in the 1940s, the first evidence of
bacteria resistance to antimicrobial therapy
emerged. Initially, these were little more than
curiosities. When they did infect patients, the
numbers were so small that at first they were
not enough to warrant much attention. But
today, they have become a fact of medical
life. Less than a century after the discovery of
penicillin, we are beginning to lose the fight."
"But this is no longer true. We have
found new, more resistant bacteria. The
vancomycin that we used to treat MRSA
infection no longer worked. We found
Vancomycin Resistant Staphylococcus
Aureus (VRSA) in our hospitals. And other
bacteria were becoming resistant too.","Since the first MRSA deaths in healthy children
in the US in 1998, the number of deaths from
MRSA infection in the US each year has
increased to tens of thousands – far more
than the number of deaths caused by AIDS.
Bacterial resistance in hospitals is everywhere.
This is a war different from any other. There
needs to be change in the way doctors
prescribe antibiotics and fewer antibiotics
used in farming and agriculture. And we have
to find a way to convince the pharmaceutical
companies to develop these less
profitable drugs.","Since the first MRSA deaths in otherwise
healthy children in the US in 1998, the number
of deaths from MRSA infection in the US
each year has risen to tens of thousands –
outstripping the number of deaths caused
by AIDS. Bacterial resistance in hospitals is
everywhere you look. This is a war like no
other. There needs to be cultural change in
our prescribing behaviours and more restraint
in the use of antibiotics in farming and
agriculture. And somehow, the pharmaceutical
companies have to be convinced to chase the
development of these less profitable drugs."
"Today, infections with organisms that are
very resistant are common, but fewer
and fewer new antibiotic drugs are made.
It is more and more difficult to develop
new drugs that can kill resistant bacteria.
Antibiotics have become drugs that are
expensive to develop, that are only used in
short courses and that quickly stop working
because of bacterial resistance.","If we are going to avoid a return to the
pre-antibiotic time with all its excess mortality,
we must make some big changes. To lose the
advantage we have against microorganisms in
the fight for life would be unthinkable.","Within my working lifetime, the pattern
of antibiotic resistance in healthcare has
transformed from a rare but notable event to
a problem of epidemic proportion. If we are to
avoid a return to the pre-antibiotic time with
all its excess mortality, we must be bold. To
squander the advantage we have so recently
gained against microorganisms in the fight for
life would be unthinkable."
"This war against bacteria is different from all
other wars. There needs to be change in the
way doctors give antibiotics and we need
to use fewer antibiotics in farming. And we
have to give companies good reasons why
they should make new antibiotics, which will
not make them lots of money.",,
"Today, antibiotic resistance has become
a normal part of life. Less than a hundred
years after the discovery of penicillin, we are
beginning to lose the fight.",,
