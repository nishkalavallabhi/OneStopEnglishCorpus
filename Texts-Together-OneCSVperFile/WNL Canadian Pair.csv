"Axani’s new travelling companion, was, of
course, called Elizabeth Gallagher. She was a
23-year-old student from Cole Harbour, Nova
Scotia. This Elizabeth Gallagher, who calls
herself Quinn, replied to an online posting
from Axani and he chose her. Before the trip,
she already had a boyfriend. But people still
hoped that the globetrotters might fall in love.
Unfortunately, they didn’t.","That’s where Axani’s new travelling companion,

Scotia, enters the story. Elizabeth Gallagher, who

explained before the trip that she had a “pretty
serious” boyfriend. But that had not stopped
journalists from hoping the globetrotters might fall
for one another. Unfortunately, it did not happen.","That’s where Axani’s new travelmate, a

Gallaghers – and was selected. Gallagher
had made it clear before the trip that she had
a “pretty serious” boyfriend but that had not
stopped romantics, and journalists, from hoping

Unfortunately, it was not to be."
"“I’m going to be very clear,” Axani said, soon after
the pair returned to Toronto. “The trip was never a
romantic idea. It was completely platonic. I do not
think of Quinn in a romantic way at all. She is a
good friend. I think of her as a little sister – that
is all.”","“I’m going to be very clear,” Axani said, soon after
the pair returned to Toronto. “This was never a
romantic endeavour. It was strictly platonic. I do
not think of Quinn in a romantic way at all. There
is no future for us romantically. She is a good
friend. I think of her as a little sister and that is it.
And our feelings are entirely mutual.”","“I’m going to be explicitly clear,” Axani said,

light in the least. There is no future for us

as a little sister but that will be it. And her feelings
are entirely mutual in that regard.” It took work to
establish that brother-sister, good-friend,
no-future-for-us-romantically relationship, however."
"But it was difficult to create that brother-sister
relationship. “It wasn’t easy and it wasn’t
immediate. It took us about a week to really
understand each other,” Axani said. They made
some mistakes as the pair got to know each
other. “At the end of the trip, we’d developed a
really great rhythm – one second, we had really
funny jokes and, the next second, we knew when
the other person needed time alone.”","It took work to create that brother-sister,

around as the pair got to know each other “about
the dos and don’ts of travelling together. At the

"The pair did not fall in love, but Axani said the
trip was “fantastic”. They visited Milan, Venice,
Vienna, Prague, Khao Lak (in Thailand) and
Hong Kong. A favourite place was Prague, Axani
said, where they met more people than anywhere
else on the trip. “During two and a half days, I
think we met about 24 people. So that’s a lot of
stories, that’s a lot of people and that’s a lot of
love for their home city of Prague.”","Although the pair did not fall in love, Axani said
