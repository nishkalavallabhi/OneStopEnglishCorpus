"Women have traditionally had a minor role in
professional football but this may be changing.
France has just employed its first female
professional team manager. It did not matter that
it was a second-division club. It did not matter if it
was, as some people suggested, just a publicity
stunt for a minor team, Clermont Foot 63.
Clermont is 14th out of the 20 teams in its league
at the moment.","Women have traditionally played a minor role in

"What mattered was that they gave Helena
Costa the top job. This has made football history
because she is the first female manager in the
top two divisions of any professional European
league. “As a woman, it’s made me happy,”
said Véronique Soulier, president of the club’s
supporters’ association. “When I first heard the
news, I was surprised, but, then, we all agreed
that it’s good news. We all agree that a woman at
the head of a group of men is no bad thing.”","What mattered was that Helena Costa had been

"The president of Clermont Foot 63, Claude
Michy, gave Costa, 36, a two-year contract.
Michy is very good at keeping his club in the

Messi Enguene, a 20-year-old midfielder
from Cameroon.","Costa, 36, was appointed on a two-year contract

"Carolina Morace, an Italian who was the only

team, said: “I don’t know Helena, but, if she has
been hired by a team, then it means that she
knows how to do her job. I hope that, one day,
this can become normal.” Morace played for Italy
in 153 internationals. In 1999, she became coach
of the men’s team Viterbese. But, after only two
games, she resigned from the job because of a
disagreement with the club’s owner. She added:
“I see too many men, even in the women’s game,
who do not have the same expertise as women
but are working. And the women are not working.”","Carolina Morace, an Italian who was the only

to play football and how to manage and are good
at doing it. Why shouldn’t they manage men’s
teams? The opposite happens and doesn’t cause
any problems. It’s a natural choice and reflects

"Clermont Foot 63 says that Costa’s becoming
the team’s manager will allow the club to enter
“a new era”. On the club supporters’ website,
reaction to Costa’s becoming the manager was
mixed. “In my opinion, it’s just a publicity stunt to
get people talking about the club. I find it hard to
believe she’ll be able to get the players’ respect,
above all when she’s the same age as the
oldest,” wrote one fan. “Her CV isn’t bad, but now
the question is: will she be good enough?” added
another. A third wrote: “I wish her welcome and
success but I think it’ll be hard for her to do well
as a woman in such a macho business.”","A statement on Clermont Foot 63’s website said

fancy carrying on in that climate of uncertainty,”
she said. Morace works today as a lawyer in
Rome and as expert soccer commentator on
television and in the pages of the daily Gazzetta
