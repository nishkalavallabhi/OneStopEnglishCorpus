they heard of her death, politicians from all parties

After a series of mini-strokes in 2002, Thatcher
withdrew from public life, no longer able to make
the kind of waspish pronouncements that had
been her forte in office – and beyond."
"British Labour Party leader, Ed Miliband,
said: “She will be remembered as a unique
person. She changed the politics of a whole
generation. She was Britain’s first woman
prime minister. She was a huge figure in
the world. The Labour Party disagreed with
a lot of what she did, but we can disagree
and also greatly respect her political
achievements and her personal strength.”","Labour Party leader, Ed Miliband, said: “She will be
remembered as a unique figure. She reshaped the
politics of a whole generation. She was Britain’s first

of British politics and was a huge figure on the world

she did and she will always be a controversial figure.
But we can disagree and also greatly respect her

courage and determination in politics and
her humanity and generous spirit in private.","The deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, said: “Margaret
Thatcher was one of the most important figures in

“She will be remembered as a unique figure. She

"The “Iron Lady” was a close ally of the US
president Ronald Reagan in the final years
of the Soviet Union. The Union broke up
because of reforms introduced by Mikhail
Gorbachev. He was the Russian leader
who Thatcher liked and worked closely
with. As a result, many ordinary people in
ex-Communist countries still think of her as
someone who supported their freedom.","Describing her as a political phenomenon, the former
Conservative prime minister Sir John Major said: “Her
outstanding characteristics will always be remembered
by those who worked closely with her: courage and
determination in politics, and humanity and generosity
of spirit in private.”","The deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, said:
“Margaret Thatcher was one of the defining
figures in modern British politics. Whatever side
of the political debate you stand on, no one can
deny that as prime minister she left a unique and
lasting imprint on the country she served.”"
"It was a surprise when Thatcher became
party leader in 1975. Within ten years, she
had become famous around the world –
people both admired and hated her – for her
reforms in the UK and her strong beliefs in
foreign policy. She had a long battle with the
IRA, which almost killed her with a bomb in
1984.","The “Iron Lady” was a cold war ally of the US
president Ronald Reagan in the final showdown
with the Soviet Union, which broke up as a result
of reformist pressures led by Mikhail Gorbachev, a
Kremlin leader with whom Thatcher famously said she
could “do business”. As a result, many ordinary voters
in ex-Soviet bloc states saw her as someone who
supported their liberty.","Describing her as a political phenomenon, the
former Tory prime minister Sir John Major said:
“Her outstanding characteristics will always be
remembered by those who worked closely with
her: courage and determination in politics, and
humanity and generosity of spirit in private.”"
"In the UK, Thatcher’s main economic policy
was the denationalization of state-owned
industry – the new word “privatization”
became used in many countries. She also
defeated militant trade unions, particularly
the National Union of Miners, after a long
and terrible strike that lasted almost a
year. With money from Britain’s North
Sea oil fields, she was able to change the
ageing industrial economy and she used
the opportunity to defeat her enemies –
including some members of her own party.","Thatcher was an unremarkable Conservative until she
unexpectedly became party leader in 1975. Within
ten years, she had become known around the world –
both admired and hated – for her pro-market reforms
in the UK and her implacable attitudes in foreign policy,
including her long battle with the IRA, which almost
succeeded in murdering her with a bomb in 1984.","The “Iron Lady” proved a significant cold war ally
of the US president Ronald Reagan in the final
showdown with the Soviet Union, which broke
up under reformist pressures led by Mikhail
Gorbachev, a Kremlin leader with whom Thatcher
famously declared she could “do business”. As
a result, many ordinary voters in ex-Soviet bloc
states saw her as a bold champion of their liberty,
a view widely shared across the spectrum of
mainstream US opinion – though not at home or
among key EU partners."
"As the British economy became healthy
again after the problems that her policies
caused, it seemed for a short time that
no-one would ever defeat her. But, as her
friends and supporters retired or were
replaced, she started to make mistakes and
became more and more unpopular. Finally,
in 1990, after a vote among Conservative
MPs failed to support her, John Major took
control of the party.","At home, Thatcher was associated with
denationalization of state-owned industry – the new
word “privatization” became used in many countries
– and defeat of militant trade unions, particularly
the National Union of Miners, whose one-year
strike (1984–85) was traumatic. With money from
Britain’s North Sea oil fields, Thatcher was able to
change the ageing industrial economy and she used
the opportunity to defeat her enemies – including
moderate members of her own party.","Thatcher was an unremarkable mid-ranking
Conservative until she unexpectedly became
party leader in 1975. Within a decade, she had
become known around the world – both admired
and detested – for her pro-market domestic
reforms and her implacable attitudes in foreign
policy, including her long-running battle with the
IRA, which almost managed to murder her when
it placed a bomb in the Grand Hotel, Brighton,
in 1984."
"After she retired, she wrote her memoirs
and continued to promote her values around
the world.","In the European Union she got a rebate for Britain –
“my money” as she called it. She was less successful
in controlling the European Commission, who
wanted to centralize power in Europe, especially in
the years when it was led by the French socialist
Jacques Delors.","At home, the emerging doctrine of Thatcherism
meant denationalization of state-owned industry
– the new word “privatization” came into
widespread use in many countries – and defeat
of militant trade unionists, notably the National
Union of Miners, whose year-long strike (1984–
85) was bitter and traumatic."
,"As the British economy recovered from the very bad
recession that her policies had caused, she seemed
invincible for a short time. But unlimited power and
the defeat or retirement of allies led to mistakes and
increasing unpopularity. When her deputy finally fell
out with her – mainly on the subject of Europe – his
damaging resignation speech led to a leadership
challenge. After a vote among Conservative MPs
failed to support her, John Major took control of
the party.","Boosted by the newly arrived revenues from
Britain’s North Sea oil fields, Thatcher had room
to manoeuvre and change the ageing industrial
economy and she used the opportunity to defeat
her enemies – including moderate members of
her own party."
,"After she retired, she wrote highly successful memoirs
and campaigned energetically for the Thatcher
Foundation, which aimed to promote her values
around the world.","But she also deployed her notorious
“handbaggings”, or verbal attacks, in the
European Union to obtain a British rebate – “my
money” as she called it. She was less successful
in fending off the centralizing ambitions of the
“Belgian Empire”, her description of the European
Commission, especially in the years when it was
headed by the French socialist Jacques Delors."
,,"Her allies in the tabloid press egged her on.
And, as the British economy recovered from the
severe recession that her monetarist medicine
had inflicted on it – to tame the unions and cure
inflation – she briefly seemed invincible."
,,"But untrammelled power, with the defeat or
retirement of allies who had kept her in check,
led to mistakes and growing unpopularity. When
Sir Geoffrey Howe, nominally her deputy, finally
fell out with Thatcher – chiefly over Europe –
his devastating resignation speech triggered a
leadership challenge. Thatcher made way for John
Major rather than risk losing to him in a ballot."
,,"In retirement, she wrote highly successful
memoirs in two volumes and campaigned
energetically on behalf of the Thatcher
Foundation, which sought to promote her values
around the world."
