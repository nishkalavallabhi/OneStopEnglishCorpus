changing individual neurons.","Susumu Tonagawa, a neuroscientist at the

several elements including records of objects,

"In the experiment, Tonagawa’s team put the
mice in a box and allowed them to explore it.
As they explored it, their brain cells created
a memory. The next day, they put the same
mice in a second box and gave them a small
electric shock. This scared the mice. At
the same time, the researchers shone light
into the mouse brains to bring back their
memories of the first box. That way, the mice
associated fear of the electric shock with the
memory of the first box.","In the experiment, Tonagawa’s team put the mice
in a box and allowed them to explore it. As they
did so, their brain cells were producing a memory
protein. The next day, the same mice were put in
a second box and given a small electric shock,
to encode a fear response. At the same time, the
researchers shone light into the mouse brains to
activate their memories of the first box. That way,
the mice learned to associate fear of the electric
shock with the memory of the first box.","In their work, Tonagawa’s team used a technique
known as optogenetics, which allows the fine
control of individual brain cells. They engineered
brain cells in the mouse hippocampus, a part
of the brain known to be involved in forming
memories, to express the gene for a protein
called channelrhodopsin. When cells that contain
channelrhodopsin are exposed to blue light,
they become activated. The researchers also
modified the hippocampus cells so that the
channelrhodopsin protein would be produced in
whichever brain cells the mouse was using to
encode its memory engrams."
"In the final part of the experiment, the team
put the mice back in the first box. The mice
froze because they were scared. However,
they had not received the shock in the first
box and had no reason to be afraid.","In the final part of the experiment, the team put
the mice back in the first box. The mice froze,
showing a typical fear response, even though
they had never been shocked in that box.","In the experiment, Tonagawa’s team placed the
mice in a chamber and allowed them to explore
it. As they did so, relevant memory-encoding
brain cells were producing the channelrhodopsin

shock, to encode a fear response. At the same
time, the researchers shone light into the mouse
brains to activate their memories of the first
chamber. That way, the mice learned to associate
fear of the electric shock with the memory of the
first chamber."
"A similar thing may happen when powerful
false memories are created in humans.
“Humans are very imaginative animals,”
said Tonagawa. “So, just like our mouse, it
is quite possible we can associate what we
have in our mind with bad or good events.
In other words, there could be a false
association of what you have in your mind
rather than what is happening to you.”","A similar process may happen when powerful

implanting false memories in a mouse brain,”
Tonagawa told Science."
"He added: “Our study showed that the false
memory and the real memory use very
similar, almost identical, brain mechanisms.
It is difficult to tell the difference between
them. We hope our future experiments will
show legal experts how unreliable memory
can be.”","He added: “Our study showed that the false

"Chris French, of the University of London,
is a researcher in false memories in people.
He said that the results of the experiments
were an important first step in understanding
false memories. He added that memory
researchers have always known that
memory does not work like a video camera,
recording all the details of anything we
experience. Instead, we build a memory
from small pieces of memory of the event,
as well as information from other places.","Chris French, of the University of London, is a

He said that the latest results were an important
first step in understanding them. “Memory
researchers have always recognized that memory
does not work like a video camera, recording all
the details of anything we experience. Instead,
it is a reconstructive process, which involves
building a specific memory from fragments of
real memory traces of the original event, but also
possibly including information from
other sources.”","He added: “Our study showed that the false
memory and the genuine memory are based on

memory can be.”"
"He warned that the false memories created
in the mice in the experiments were far
simpler than the complex false memories
people have, such as false memories of
childhood sexual abuse, abduction by
aliens, or “past lives”. These complex false
memories involve many parts of the brain.
French says that it will be a long time before
we understand how our brains make these
memories.","He warned that the false memories created in
the mice in the experiments were far simpler than
the complex false memories that have caused
controversy within psychology and psychiatry –
for example, false memories of childhood sexual

rich false memories will clearly involve many
brain systems and we are still a long way from
understanding the processes involved in their
formation at the neuronal level,” he said.","Chris French, head of the Anomalistic

"The mouse models created by the MIT
team will help scientists ask more complex
questions about memories in people.
“Now that we can change the contents of
memories in the brain, we can begin asking
questions that used to be philosophical
questions,” said Steve Ramirez, who works
with Tonagawa at MIT. “Can we create false
memories? What about false memories for
more than just places – false memories for
objects, food or other mice? These used to
be sci-fi questions but we can now research
them in the lab.”","Mark Stokes, a neuroscientist at Oxford
University, said the experiments were a great
achievement but that it was important to put
them into perspective. “Although the results
seem to show that new memories were formed
by the artificial stimulation (rather than the actual
environment), this kind of phenomenon is still a long
way from most people’s idea of memory,” he said.","He cautioned that the false memories created in
the mice in the experiments were far simpler than
the complex false memories that have generated
controversy within psychology and psychiatry –

satanic abuse, abduction by aliens, or “past
lives”. “Such rich false memories will clearly
involve many brain systems and we are still a
long way from understanding the processes
involved in their formation at the neuronal level,”
said Professor French."
,"The mouse models created by the MIT team
will help scientists ask more and more complex
questions about memories in people. “Now
that we can change the contents of memories
in the brain, we can begin asking questions
that were once the realm of philosophy,” said
Steve Ramirez, a colleague of Tonagawa’s at
MIT. “Are there multiple conditions that lead
to the formation of false memories? Can false
memories be artificially created? What about
false memories for more than just contexts –
false memories for objects, food or other mice?
These are the seemingly sci-fi questions that can
now be experimentally tackled in the lab.”","Mark Stokes, a neuroscientist at Oxford
University, said the experiments were a “tour de
force” but that it was important to put them into
perspective. “Although the results seem to imply
that new memories were formed by the artificial
stimulation (rather than the actual environment),
this kind of phenomenon is still a long way
from most people’s idea of memory,” he said.
Rather, he said, it was equivalent to implanting
an association that perhaps someone cannot
place but that makes them wary of a specific
environment for no apparent reason. “It is unlikely
that this kind of pairing could lead to the rich
set of associations related to normal memories,
although it is possible that, over time, such
pairing could be integrated with other memories
to construct a more elaborate false narrative.”"
,"As the technology develops, said French,
scientists need to think about its uses carefully. “In whatever way we implant false memories, we
need to be very aware of the ethical issues raised
by such procedures – the potential for abuse of
such techniques cannot be overstated.”","The mouse models created by the MIT team will
