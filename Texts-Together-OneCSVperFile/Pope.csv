"When Pope Benedict XVI was elected in
2005, he said he was “a simple, humble
worker in God’s vineyard”. And on a grey,
cold, windy Monday in February, he resigned
in the same way: like an old workman with
pains in his back and no more strength in
his arms. The first German Pope in modern
times gave an exact departure time. “From
28 February 2013, at 20.00 hours”, he told
a gathering of cardinals in the Vatican, “the
see of Rome, the see of Saint Peter, will be
vacant and there will be an election for a
new Pope.”","Pope Benedict XVI arrived in 2005 as “a

And on a grey, cold, windy Monday in

an elderly labourer who can no longer ignore
the pains in his back; who can no longer
rely on the strength of his arms. A traditional
Pope, he made his excuses in Latin. The

simple, humble worker in God’s vineyard”. And
on a grey, cold, blustery Monday in February,
Pope Benedict XVI signed off in the same
fashion: like an elderly labourer who can no
longer ignore the pains in his back; who can
no more count on the strength of his arms.
Characteristically for this most traditionally
minded of pontiffs, he made his excuses in
Latin. The first German pope in modern times
timed his departure to the minute. “From 28
February 2013, at 20.00 hours”, he told a
gathering of cardinals in the Vatican, “the see
of Rome, the see of Saint Peter, will be vacant
and a conclave to elect the new supreme
pontiff will have to be convoked by those whose
competence it is.”"
"One of the cardinals at the gathering was a
Mexican cardinal, Monsignor Oscar Sanchéz
Barba, from Guadalajara. He was in Rome
for an official meeting. “We were all in the
Apostolic Palace,” he said. “The Pope took a
sheet of paper and read from it.","Among those present was a Mexican

Monsignor Oscar Sanchéz Barba, from
Guadalajara. He was in Rome to be told the
date for a canonization in which he has played
a leading role. “We were all in the Sala del
Concistoro in the third loggia of the Apostolic
Palace,” he said. “After giving the date for the
canonization, the twelfth of May, the Pope took a
sheet of paper and read from it."
"“We were all …” – Sanchéz Barba couldn’t
find the word. The cardinals had just heard
the man they believe is God’s representative
on earth resign. “The cardinals were just
looking at one another,” Sanchéz
Barba said.","“We were all left …” – Sanchéz Barba
looked around him in St Peter’s Square,
looking for the word; he was as speechless
as the “princes of the church” who had just
heard the man they believe to be God’s
representative on earth give up the job. “The
cardinals were just looking at one another,”
Sanchéz Barba said.","“We were all left …” – Sanchéz Barba looked
around him in the Bernini colonnade that
embraces St Peter’s Square, grasping for
the word, as speechless as the “princes of

believe to be God’s representative on earth give
up on the job. “The cardinals were just looking at
one another,” Sanchéz Barba said."
"Angelo Sodano, the Dean of the College
of Cardinals, who probably already knew
about the Pope’s decision, gave a short
speech. He told the Pope that the cardinals
would be loyal to him and added that he
and the others present had listened to the
Pope’s words with a feeling of confusion.
At the end of his speech, the pope blessed
the cardinals and left. “It was so simple;
the simplest thing you can imagine,” said
Sanchéz Barba. “Then we all left in silence.
There was absolute silence …
and sadness.”","Angelo Sodano, the Dean of the College
of Cardinals, who must have known
beforehand, gave a brief speech. Before
going on to assure the Pope of the cardinals’
loyalty and devotion, he said he and the
others present had “listened to you with
a sense of confusion, almost completely
incredulous”. At the end of his speech,
the Pope blessed the people present, and
left. “It was so simple; the simplest thing
imaginable,” said Sanchéz Barba. “Then we
all left in silence. There was absolute silence

to you with a sense of bewilderment, almost
completely incredulous”. At the end of his
address, the Pope blessed those present,

"John Thavis spent 30 years reporting on
the Vatican and has a book, The Vatican
Diaries, that will be published soon. He
said he had a feeling before that the Pope
was going to resign. Thavis said that in the
long interview Benedict gave to a German
journalist in 2010, he had said he would
resign if he felt he could no longer do the
job. “I asked myself: if I were Pope and
wanted to resign, when would I choose?
He has completed his series of books and
most of his projects. Also, there were no
dates in his calendar of events he had to
attend. I thought the most likely date was 22
February but I got it wrong.”","John Thavis, who spent 30 years reporting
on the Vatican and whose book, The Vatican
Diaries, is soon to be published, said he
had had a feeling the Pope might be about
to resign and timed his return to Rome from
the US accordingly. Thavis noted that in the
long interview Benedict gave to a German
journalist in 2010, he had made it clear
he considered it would be right to go if he
felt he could no longer do the job. “I asked
myself: if I were Pope and wanted to resign,
when would I choose? He has completed
his series of books and most of his projects.
What is more, there were no dates in his
calendar of events he personally had to
attend. I thought the most likely date was 22

the Holy See and whose book, The Vatican
Diaries, is soon to be published, said he had
had an intuition the Pope might be about to
resign and timed his return to Rome from
the US accordingly. A fellow-Vatican watcher
confirmed this to be the case. Thavis noted
that in the book-length interview Benedict gave
to a German journalist, published as Light of
the World in 2010, he had made it clear he
considered it would be right to go if he felt he
were no longer up to the job. “I asked myself: if
I were Pope and wanted to resign, when would
I choose? He has completed his series of books
and most of his projects are off the ground.
What is more, there were no dates in his
calendar of events he personally had to attend.
I thought the most likely date was 22 February,
which is the Feast of the Chair of St Peter. So I
got it wrong.”"
"Soon after the announcement, the Vatican
was saying that the Pope’s decision
was brave. Thavis agreed: “What I find
particularly courageous is that he is going
now, when he is not sick; and that he’s
leaving because he’s tired and not because
he’s ill.” But is that the whole story? Does
the Pope know more about his state of
health than the Vatican has so far
made public?","Within hours of the announcement, Vatican
officials were saying that the Pope’s
decision was a brave one. Thavis agreed:
“What I find particularly courageous is that
he is prepared to say now, when he is not
sick, that he is going; and that he’s doing
it because he’s tired and not because he’s
particularly ill.” But is that the whole story?
Does he know more about his state of health
than the Vatican has so far made public?","The line emerging from the Vatican within hours
of the announcement was that the Pope’s
decision was a brave one. By this account,
Benedict – never one to shrink from utterances
and decisions that shocked – had taken it upon
himself to bring his church face to face with
reality: the reality that contemporary medicine
can keep men alive far beyond the age at which
they are up to grappling with the demands
of running a vast global organization. Thavis
agreed: “What I find particularly courageous
is that he is prepared to say now, when he is
not sick, that he is going; and that he’s doing
it because he’s tired and not because he’s
particularly ill.” But is that the whole story? Does
he know more about his state of health than the
Vatican has so far made public?"
"Benedict said that he is resigning not just for
physical reasons but also for psychological
reasons. He said that the position of Pope
needed both strength of mind and strength
of body, and in the last few months he felt
that he was slowly losing that strength.
There will no doubt be other theories in
future days and weeks, just as there were
following the death of Pope John Paul I in
1978, 33 days after his election. Already
people are saying that there was a secret
in Benedict’s past and that somebody was
going to tell everyone. The Vatican will no
doubt say those stories are nonsense. But
we can understand why some people think
there might be a secret, because Benedict’s
decision is so historic.","Benedict’s own reasons make it clear that
he took into account not only his physical,
but also his psychological condition. He
said that the position of pope required both
strength of mind and strength of body, and in
the last few months he felt that strength was
gradually decreasing. There will no doubt be
other theories in the days and weeks ahead,
just as there were following the death of
Pope John Paul I in 1978, 33 days after his
election. Already there is speculation that
some information was about to come out
about Benedict’s past. The Vatican will no
doubt dismiss any such stories. But they
are understandable, for the transcendental
importance of what Benedict has done
cannot be overstated.","Benedict’s own account of his reasons makes
it clear that he took into account not only his
physical, but also his psychological condition:
“In order to govern the bark of Saint Peter and
proclaim the Gospel, both strength of mind and
body are necessary, strength which in the last
few months has deteriorated in me to the extent
that I have had to recognize my incapacity to
adequately fulfil the ministry entrusted to me.”
Other theories will no doubt swirl around the
Vatican in the days and weeks ahead, just as
they did following the death of Pope John Paul
I in 1978, 33 days after his election. Already
there is speculation that something was about
to come out about Benedict’s past. The Vatican will just as predictably dismiss such notions with
contempt. But they are understandable all the
same, for the transcendental importance of what
Benedict has done cannot be overstated."
"At St Peter’s Basilica, Julia Rochester, from
London, still didn’t know what the Pope’s
resignation meant. “If you’re God’s chosen
person, how do you choose not be chosen?”
she asked. It is a question many Catholics
will be asking their priests in future weeks.","Coming out of St Peter’s Basilica, Julia

Rochester, from London, who described herself
as a lapsed Catholic, was still turning over
the implications of the Pope’s resignation. “If
you’re God’s chosen one, how do you choose
not be chosen?” she mused. It is a question
many practising Catholics will be asking of their
priests in the weeks ahead. In his first speech
as Pope – humbly disclaiming his fitness for the
task – Benedict said: “I am consoled by the fact
that the Lord knows how to work and how to act,
even with insufficient tools.” At some point in the
last eight years, it would seem, he ceased to
believe that was true."
