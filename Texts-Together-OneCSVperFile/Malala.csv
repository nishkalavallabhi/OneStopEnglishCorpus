"“The extremists are afraid of books and
pens,” the teenager continued. “The power
of education frightens them. They are afraid
of women. The power of the voice of women
frightens them.”","She spoke confidently, with only an injured eye
and a slightly drooping left side of her face to
hint at such fresh traumas. There was one other

did not survive: Benazir Bhutto, the former prime
minister of Pakistan.","She spoke confidently, with only an injured eye

their duty and responsibility.”","And she gave her own opposing interpretation
