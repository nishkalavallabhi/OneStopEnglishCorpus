"Europe is trying to reduce air pollution. Europe
will become the first part of the world to force
car makers to use ‘real-world’ emissions tests.
New regulations will introduce tests that will
demonstrate clearly what cars’ emissions are like
when they are driving on roads and in traffic, not
in ideal conditions, similar to a laboratory.","In an attempt to reduce air pollution, Europe will

"The European Commission has approved the
tests. The tests will make sure all cars meet a
limit of 80mg of nitrogen oxide per kilometre. At
present, only one car in 16 meets this limit. Other
countries, such as China and Korea, are also
considering real-world emissions tests. They will
watch what happens next closely.","The tests, which have been approved by the
European Commission, are designed to enforce

be watching what happens closely.","Green lit by European Commission Vice
President, Frans Timmermans, the tests are

"In the UK, 29,000 people die every year because
of pollution. Pollutants from diesel engines such
as nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide are
responsible for at least one quarter of
those deaths.","Pollutants from diesel engines such as nitrogen
oxide, carbon monoxide and particulates are
believed to be responsible for at least one quarter
of the 29,000 annual pollution-related deaths in
the UK alone.","Pollutants from diesel engines such as nitrogen
oxide, carbon monoxide and particulates are
thought to be responsible for at least one quarter
of the 29,000 annual pollution-related deaths in
the UK alone. That figure is likely to rise, when
the committee on the medical effects of air
pollutants publishes what it calls
“strengthening evidence” of damage to public
health from nitrogen oxide emissions later
in 2015."
"The current laboratory test for measuring
emissions is 25 years old and it needs to change.
Car makers can cheat during the tests on their
cars using various techniques. For example, they
can tape up doors and windows to reduce air
resistance, drive on really smooth roads and test
at very high temperatures.","The current ‘New European Drive Cycle’
laboratory test for measuring emissions is
a quarter of a century old. Technological
developments in the car industry mean that the
test is no longer good enough. Studies have
shown that the results of lab techniques to
measure car emissions can easily be fixed – car
makers fix the results by using techniques such
as taping up doors and windows to minimize
air resistance, driving on unrealistically smooth
roads and testing at very high temperatures.","But the current ‘New European Drive Cycle’
laboratory test for measuring these emissions is
a quarter of a century old and has been outpaced
by technological developments in the car industry.
Studies have shown that the results of lab
techniques to measure car emissions can easily
be fixed by using techniques such as taping up
doors and windows to minimize air resistance,
driving on unrealistically smooth roads and
testing at improbably high temperatures.
Campaigners say that car makers also use tricks
such as programming vehicles to go into a low
emissions mode when their front wheels are
spinning and their back wheels are stationary, as
happens in such lab experiments."
"“The Commission will introduce a new
emissions test that will properly check the cars
in real driving,” said Lucia Caudet, a
Commission spokesperson.","“The Commission wants to introduce a new
emissions testing procedure that will allow proper
assessment of the vehicles in real driving,” said
Lucia Caudet, a Commission spokesperson.","“The Commission is finalizing a proposal to
introduce a new emissions testing procedure that
will allow proper assessment of the vehicles in
real driving,” said Lucia Caudet, a Commission
spokesperson. The proposal still needs approval
from other commissioners and a technical
committee but “we don’t expect any major
internal hurdles,” a European Union (EU)
source added."
"“One key reason why air pollution kills 400,000
European citizens each year is that car makers
cheat the tests for diesel cars – this causes
much more pollution on the road,” said Greg
Archer, the clean vehicles manager for Transport
and Environment. “The development of a new,
real-world driving emission test is an important
step towards reducing air pollution in cities.
European Union (EU) states should now support
the Commission’s idea. They should ignore the
complaints from car makers, who say that the
rules are too tough.”","“One key reason why air pollution kills 400,000

"According to research by the International
Council on Clean Transportation in 2014, actual
nitrogen oxide emissions from cars are seven
times higher than the 80mg per kilometre
standard and some cars are 22 times above the
recommended limit. About one third of all nitrogen
oxide pollution comes from road transport –
mostly diesel – and, in cities, concentrations
can be as high as 64%, according to European
Environment Agency data.","According to research by the International

"Campaigners say that car makers have tried to
delay reforms to car tests. But car makers do
not agree – they say that they need five years
to introduce the changes for technical and
economic reasons. “Real Driving Emissions is
a totally new regulation that will force significant
changes,” said Cara McLaughlin, a spokesperson
for the European Automobile Manufacturers
Association (ACEA). “But ACEA fully accepts that
the regulation will apply to new types of cars from
September 2017.”","Campaigners say that the car industry has tried

"When EU representatives finally agreed a
regulation for nitrogen oxide limits – with stricter
road trials and monitoring of exhaust fumes –
ACEA sent the European Commission their own
draft regulation. ACEA’s draft regulation covered
fewer pollutants and they wanted to introduce
the regulation only in 2020. It included shorter
test distances (from 1,300 metres to below 700
metres), raised minimum temperatures from -7C
to -3C and wanted to use more country roads for
the tests.","ACEA sent the European Commission their
own draft regulation for consideration, after
EU representatives finally agreed a regulation
to implement the nitrogen oxide limits with
strengthened road trials and strict monitoring of

have covered fewer pollutants and delayed the
regulation’s introduction until 2020. Test distances
would have been shortened from 1,300m to
below 700m, minimum temperatures would have
been raised from -7C to -3C and more rural roads
would have been used.","In an unusual move, the car association sent
Timmermans a draft regulation of their own for
him to consider, after EU representatives finally

regulation would have covered fewer pollutants and further delayed the regulation’s phased
introduction until 2020. Test distances would have
been shortened from 1,300m to below 700m,
minimum temperatures would have been raised
from -7C to -3C and more rural roads would
have been used. “The lobbyists were all over
this,” Archer said. “This was a real attempt at
subversion of the legislative process.”"
"The Commission rejected ACEA’s draft
regulation. The new regulation will now probably
be introduced in September. By 2017, the first
real-world car emissions tests should begin.
Countries around the world will watch the
introduction of the EU’s new emissions
tests carefully.","The ACEA draft was rejected by the Commission.

commissioners for approval before an expected
introduction in September. By 2017, the first realworld

in earnest. The introduction of the EU’s new
emission tests will be watched closely around
the world.","After Timmerman’s apparent rejection of the
ACEA proposal, the regulation will now pass to
commissioners for a rubber stamp, and member
states for final amendments, before an expected
introduction in September. By 2017, the first

begin in earnest. With a similar battle already
looming over the testing of CO2 emissions for
cars at the end of 2015 – and with comparable
debates in other countries – the introduction of
the EU’s new emissions tests will be
watched closely."
