"A group of experts say that thousands of people
are taking unnecessary medicines and have bad
diets because of bogus allergy tests. Allergies
and food intolerances are increasing very quickly
but people do not understand the difference
between an allergy and a food intolerance – this
is causing problems, says the charity Sense
About Science, who have written a guide
to allergies.","According to a group of experts, bogus allergy

harm, said the charity Sense About Science,

"“It’s a big mess,” said Tracey Brown, director of
Sense About Science. “There is unnecessary
action for people who don’t really have allergies
and not enough action for people who
have allergies.”","“It’s probably the biggest mess for science
communication – there are myths, misinterpreted
studies and bad medical practice. All this results
in under- and over-diagnosis,” said Tracey
Brown, director of Sense About Science. “The
costs are huge – unnecessary actions for some
and not enough action for those whose lives
depend on it.”","“It’s probably the biggest mess for science

"Lots of people tell the waiter or waitress in a
restaurant that they have an allergy. But some of
these people don’t have an allergy – that have a
food intolerance, which is not dangerous. Experts
fear that restaurants hear so many people say
that they have allergies (when maybe that is not
true) that they may not be careful enough when
they give food to a person who has a real allergy.","Experts fear that restaurants and caterers hear
so many people say that they have allergies

precautions they should take when serving a
person who has a genuine allergy.","Experts fear that restaurants and caterers

"“It matters very much,” said Moira Austin of an
allergy charity. “If a restaurant thinks somebody
just doesn’t want to eat a food because it makes
them feel uncomfortable, the restaurant may
be less careful. There have been deaths where
people have gone to a restaurant, told the waiter
or waitress that they have an allergy to a food
and the meal has been given to them containing
that food.”","“It matters very much,” said Moira Austin of
a charity that supports people suffering from
anaphylaxis. “If a caterer thinks somebody is just
avoiding a food because they don’t want to get
bloated, they may be less careful. There have
been a number of fatalities where people have
gone to a restaurant, told staff that they have an
allergy to a particular food and the meal has been
served up containing that allergen.”","“It matters very much,” said Moira Austin of

"The guide says most allergy tests bought on the
internet or in shops do not work. They include
a test people can use at home, which looks for
specific antibodies against different foods in the
blood. These antibodies are part of the body’s
response to infections but “the best medical
evidence has shown high antibody levels do not
suggest an allergy”, the guide says. The test
often shows people have an allergy or a food
intolerance when this is not true.","The guide says most internet and shop-bought
allergy tests have no scientific basis. They
include a home-testing kit that looks for specific
immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against foods
in the blood. These antibodies are part of the
immune system’s response to infections but “the
best medical evidence has shown that high IgG
levels do not suggest an allergy,” the guide says.
“Results are often positive in people who do not

to infections, “the best medical evidence has
shown elevated IgG levels do not suggest an
allergy”, the guide says. “Results are frequently
positive in individuals who do not have an

"Another test also does not work. It uses a mixture
of acupuncture and homeopathy. Testing hair is
also pointless, the guide says. “Hair cannot show
if you are allergic or not so testing hair cannot
give any useful information on allergies.”","Also unscientific is another test, a mixture of
acupuncture and homeopathy. It attempts to
measure electronic resistance across the skin
while the child or adult holds the suspect food in
their hand. Hair sample testing is also pointless,
the guide says. “Hair is not involved in allergic
reactions so testing hair samples cannot provide
any useful information on allergies.”","Also debunked is a test, a mixture of

the guide says. “Hair is not involved in allergic
reactions so testing hair samples cannot provide
any useful information on allergic status.” Nor
should people be deceived into thinking allergies
are caused by an “energy blockage” that can be
diagnosed by muscle testing and cured
by acupuncture."
"“I often see children who are on very limited diets
– their parents believe that they have allergies
because they have taken ‘allergy tests’ that do
not work,” said Paul Seddon, an allergy doctor
for children. “This needs to stop, which can only
happen if we prove these ‘tests’ do not work.”","“I commonly see children who have been put on
to unnecessarily restricted diets. Their parents
assume, in good faith, that they have allergies
to multiple foods because of ‘allergy tests’ that
have no scientific basis,” said Paul Seddon, a
paediatric allergist. “This needs to stop, which
can only happen if we prove these ‘tests’
are unscientific.”","“I commonly see children who’ve been put

"Allergies can cause tiredness, headaches and
eczema in children. But you need to check if they
have an allergy and this takes a long time and
many tests. It may seem like a good idea to do
just one test and get a quick answer. But, it will
be a wrong answer.","Another paediatric allergist, Adam Fox said: “I get
a number of patients who come in after sending
their hair off for analysis or after excluding a
whole range of foods for their children. It is
very difficult to deal with that. There are two
challenges. Children need to be given proper
diets but it is the unnecessary avoidance of
things that aren’t harmful that has a huge impact
on the quality of life. A child who can’t eat wheat
or drink milk can’t go to parties.”","Another consultant paediatric allergist, Adam
Fox from Guys and St Thomas’ Hospital in
London, said: “I get a number of patients,
and my colleagues likewise, who will come in

excluded a whole range of foods for their
children. It is very difficult to untangle that. There
are two challenges. Children need to be given
proper diets but more of it is the unnecessary
avoidance of things that aren’t harmful, which

"Allergies are increasing in developed countries.
There are three times more children with certain
allergies now compared to 30 years ago. The
Sense About Science guide lists a number of
myths about the sources of allergies, for example
the myths that fast food or E numbers in food
colourings cause allergies.","The belief that a child’s chronic lack of energy or
headaches or eczema are caused by an allergy
takes a long time and many tests to prove or
disprove. It is tempting to go to an alternative
therapist who will do one test and provide a
quick, but wrong, answer.","The conviction that a child’s chronic lethargy or
headaches or eczema are caused by an allergy

,"Allergies are increasing in developed countries.
The percentages of children diagnosed with
allergic rhinitis and eczema have both trebled
in the last 30 years. This is leading many more
people to suspect allergies are the reason for
their own or their children’s health problems. The
guide lists a number of myths about the sources
of allergies, from the suggestion that they are
caused by E numbers in food colourings to “toxic
overload” and fast food.","Allergies are on the rise across developed
