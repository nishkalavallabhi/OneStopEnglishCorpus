"Some cities have pigeons. Lima has black
vultures. They fly in groups over the city and sit on
the city’s buildings. With their wrinkly heads and
small, round eyes, they remind Lima residents of
the poverty and filth in their city.","Some cities have pigeons. Lima has black vultures.

or gallinazos. They circle in groups overhead and
perch on the city’s most emblematic buildings –
the decrepit, colonial-era churches and crumbling
eighteenth-century piles in the city centre. In many

would rather ignore: the neglect, poverty and filth."
"But the vultures’ taste for dead and decaying
things has become a good thing. Environmental
authorities are putting GoPro video cameras and
GPS trackers on the birds – the birds now work in
the fight against fly-tipping and illegal dumping.","But these birds’ taste for dead and decaying things
has become a virtue. Environmental authorities are
kitting the birds out with GoPro video cameras and
GPS trackers – the birds have a new mission in
the fight against fly-tipping and illegal dumping.","But these carrion-eaters’ natural affinity for dead
and decaying things is being turned into a virtue.
Environmental authorities are giving these muchmaligned
birds a PR makeover, kitting them

"Samuel is one of the project’s ten black vultures
that are looking for rubbish. He wears his tracker
and flies above the city, where he finds secret or
hidden dumps. The exact positions of the rubbish
dumps are recorded on a live map.","Samuel is one of the project’s ten disease-free
black vultures that are looking for rubbish. Fitted
with his tracker, he is set free above the city, where

Coragyps atratus that have been charged with

"USAID and the Peruvian Environment Ministry
are working together on this project to try to solve
Lima’s rubbish problem. The vultures are fighting
disease, while most humans ignore the danger.","USAID and the Peruvian Environment Ministry are

rubbish problem. A tongue-in-cheek video adds
a melodramatic voiceover, in which the noble
vultures are fighting disease, while humans ignore
the danger.","The effort is a collaboration between USAID
and the Peruvian Environment Ministry to tackle
Lima’s rubbish problem. Samuel’s other airborne
companions have been given more evocative
names: Capitan Huggin, Capitan Fenix (named
after the mythological creature that rises from the
ashes) and Capitana Aella (“Whirlwind”). A tonguein-
cheek video adds a melodramatic voiceover, in
which the noble “carthatidae lineage – the vultures”
are pitted against pestilence and disease, while
“humanity is placidly ignoring the danger”."
"Lima has nearly ten million inhabitants but just four
landfills so there are many illegal dumps. A fifth
of the city’s rubbish goes into the illegal dumps,
according to the Environment Ministry. The rubbish
makes the water of Lima’s main water source, the
Rimac river, dirty. It also makes the water of the
Chillon and Lurin rivers, which flow into the Bay of
Lima, dirty.","The project makes a serious point. With just four
landfills in a city of nearly ten million inhabitants,
there are many illegal dumps. A fifth of the

as the Chillon and Lurin rivers, which flow into the

"Three poorer districts have only 12% of Lima’s

rubbish than other neighbourhoods: Villa Maria del
Triunfo (39.4%), Villa El Salvador (25.3%) and El
Agustino (18.3%).","The environmental supervision agency, OEFA,

"Part of the problem is unpaid taxes. Many
residents don’t pay their taxes. That means some
of the 43 districts of the city do not have enough
money for rubbish collection.","Part of the problem is unpaid taxes. Many
residents just don’t pay. That means some of the

"It also means that it is possible that nobody is
going to clean up where the vultures find illegal
rubbish. “We tell the local governments where
the vultures found illegal dumps,” says Javier
Hernandez, the project director. “It’s their job to
collect the rubbish and to try and change the habits
of their residents.”","It also means nobody is necessarily going to
clean up where the vultures identify illegal trash.

,"The project aims to encourage residents to be
“vultures on the ground”: to report fly-tipping,
cut back on their own waste and recycle. Some
residents are responding, posting photos of illegal
dumps on the Twitter feed and Facebook page.","The project aims to encourage citizens to be

,,"The idea was hatched at the 2014 United Nations
Climate Change Conference, hosted in Lima.
“We were looking for ways to involve not just
the authorities but also citizens to generate
environmental awareness,” Hernandez says.
Artist Cristina Planas had placed huge, sculpted
vulture heads on top of 25 dead palm trees in
a wetland reserve in the south of the city. Rich
residents hated it as an ugly imposition but Planas
invited citizens to “adopt a vulture” in support of
conservation and recycling."
,,"“We are a little scared of the vulture’s appearance,”
she said. “But in reality, he is out there sacrificing
himself for us. He is out there recycling, in the last
place we threw out our rubbish.”"
