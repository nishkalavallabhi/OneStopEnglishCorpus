"The vice-president of Google has warned that

Vint Cerf told the American Association for the
Advancement of Science’s annual meeting. He said
that we might become a “forgotten generation or

"Cerf said we should develop digital methods to
preserve old software and hardware to read old
files. “So much of the information about our daily
lives is in digital form, like our interactions by email,
people’s tweets and all of the world wide web. So
it’s clear that we could lose a lot of our history,” he
said. “If we want to keep it, we need to make sure
that people can still see the digital objects we create
today in the future,” he added.","Cerf says we need to develop digital methods
to preserve old software and hardware so that
out-of-date files can be recovered even if they are
really old. “When you think about the quantity of

people’s tweets and all of the world wide web, it’s
clear that we could lose an awful lot of our history,”
he said. “We don’t want our digital lives to fade

"What is ‘bit rot’ and is Vint Cerf right to be worried?
His warning highlights an irony about modern
technology: we digitize music, photos, letters and
other documents so that they survive for centuries
but the programs and hardware people will need to
read those files don’t survive.","What is ‘bit rot’ and is Vint Cerf right to be

"“We are throwing all of our data into an information
black hole. We digitize things because we think we
will preserve them. But what we don’t understand is
that, if we don’t do something, those digital versions
may not be any better than the things that we
digitized. In fact, they may be worse,” Cerf says. “If
there are photos you really care about, print
them out.”","“We are throwing all of our data into what could

"Ancient civilizations did not have these problems

special software and sometimes hardware, too.","Ancient civilizations did not have these problems

"Cerf warns that we will also lose important political
and historical documents because of bit rot. In
2005, American historian Doris Kearns Goodwin
wrote a book about Abraham Lincoln. She went
to libraries around the US and found the paper
letters of the people involved. “In today’s world,
those letters would be emails and it will be almost
impossible to find them one hundred years from
now,” said Cerf.","Cerf warns that important political and historical

"He admits that historians will try to preserve
important material. But he says that people often
don’t understand the importance of documents until
hundreds of years later. Historians have learned
how Archimedes thought about infinity in 3BC
because they found his writings hidden under the
words of a thirteenth-century book. “We’ve been
surprised by what we’ve learned from objects that
have been preserved by accident,” he said.","He concedes that historians will take steps to
preserve material considered important by today’s
standards. But he argues that the significance of

of infinity and anticipated calculus in 3BC after
his writings were found hidden under the words

"Inventing new technology helps but it is only part
of the solution. It could be even more difficult to get
the legal permissions to copy and store software
before it dies. “To do this properly, we might need to
think about things like copyright. We’re talking about
preserving documents for hundreds to thousands of
years,” said Cerf.","Inventing new technology is only half the battle,
though. It could be even more difficult to obtain the
