"A new study shows that there are more and
more brown bears, wolves and lynx in the forests
and suburban areas of Europe. Rising human
populations and use of resources have made
many people believe that these animals could soon
become extinct. But the study says that numbers of
large predators are stable or rising in Europe.","The forests – and suburbs – of Europe are
echoing with the growls and howls of large
predators according to a new study. The study

extinct. But the study has found that large-predator
populations are stable or rising in Europe.","The forests – and suburbs – of Europe are

"Brown bears, wolves and the Eurasian lynx are
found in nearly one-third of mainland Europe
(excluding Belarus, Ukraine and Russia). Most
live outside nature reserves – this shows that
changing attitudes and conservation methods are
protecting these species very well.","Brown bears, wolves and the Eurasian lynx are

"Bears are the most common large carnivore
in Europe – there are around 17,000 bears.
There are 12,000 wolves and 9,000 Eurasian
lynx. Only Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands
and Luxembourg in mainland Europe have
no breeding populations of at least one large
carnivore species. Britain also has none. But the
study said these animals live in regions of Europe
where lots of people live and this shows that they
could live even in the British countryside.","Bears are the most abundant large carnivore in

Only Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and

have no breeding populations of at least one large

other conservationists said that these animals now
live in well-populated regions of Europe, so even
the British countryside could support big predators.","Bears are the most abundant large carnivore in
Europe, with around 17,000 individuals, alongside

parts of Scandinavia and Finland. Only Belgium,
Denmark, the Netherlands and Luxembourg in
mainland Europe – like Britain – have no breeding
populations of at least one large carnivore
species. But the paper’s lead author and other
conservationists said these animals’ surprising
distribution across well-populated regions of
Europe showed that even the British countryside
could support big predators."
"Guillaume Chapron from Sweden’s University
of Agricultural Sciences and researchers across
Europe found wolves living in suburban areas
with up to 3,050 people per square kilometre. On
average in Europe, wolves live on land where
there are 37 people per square kilometre, lynx
in areas where there are 21 people per square
kilometre and bears where there are 19 people per
square kilometre. In the Scottish Highlands there
are just nine people per square kilometre.","Guillaume Chapron from Sweden’s University

"“To have wolves, we don’t need to remove people
from the landscape,” said Chapron. He also said
that the big carnivore revival shows the success
of a “land-sharing” method of conservation – it is
different from the method in North America and
Africa, where they use fences to separate these
animals in “wilderness” areas.","“In order to have wolves, we don’t need to
remove people from the landscape,” said
Chapron. He adds that the big-carnivore revival
shows the success of a “land-sharing” model
of conservation – unlike the policy of keeping
predators and people apart by fencing off
“wilderness” areas, as occurs in North America
and Africa.","“In order to have wolves, we don’t need to

Chapron. According to Chapron and his
colleagues, the big-carnivore revival shows the

people apart by fencing off “wilderness” areas, as
occurs in North America and Africa."
"“I’m not saying it’s a perfect love story – living
together often means conflict – but it’s important
to control that conflict and resolve the problems it
causes. Wolves can be difficult neighbours,”
said Chapron.","“I’m not saying it’s a peace-and-love story
– coexistence often means conflict – but it’s
important to manage that conflict and resolve
the problems it causes. Wolves can be difficult
neighbours,” said Chapron. “We shouldn’t be
talking about people-predator conflict; we have
conflict between people about predators. These
animals are symbolic of difficult questions about
how we should use the land.”","“I’m not saying it’s a peace-and-love story
– coexistence often means conflict – but it’s

level and resolve the problems it causes. Wolves

conflict; we have conflict between people about

"According to the researchers, countries in other
parts of the world could use this “land-sharing”
method. Land-sharing works in Europe because
there are more and more animals such as wild
deer for the predators to eat and there is money
for electric fences to protect livestock fences,
so farmers do not have to shoot wild predators.
Most important, said Chapron, is the EU Habitats
Directive, which has forced member states to
protect and revive rare species.","According to the researchers, this “land-sharing”
approach could be applied elsewhere in the world.
The reasons for its success in Europe include
political stability, growing populations of prey species
such as wild deer, and financial support for nonlethal
livestock protection such as electric fences,
which mean that farmers do not have to shoot wild
predators. Most crucial, said Chapron, has been the
EU Habitats Directive, which has forced member
states to protect and revive rare species.","According to the researchers, this “land-sharing”

"“Without the Habitats Directive, I don’t think we
would have had this revival,” he said. “It shows
that we can protect animals, if people really
want to help and if politicians make strong laws.”
Author George Monbiot was happy about the
revival. He is starting a charity called Rewilding
Britain. It encourages the return of wild landscape
and extinct species.","“Without the Habitats Directive, I don’t think
we would have had this recovery,” he said. “It
shows that, if people are willing to protect nature
and if politicians introduce strong legislation, it’s
possible to achieve results in wildlife protection.”

Monbiot, who is launching Rewilding Britain,

"“It is great to see more of these animals in
Europe. But Britain is completely different – we’ve
lost more of our large animals than any country
except for Ireland,” he said. “We accidentally
reintroduced wild boar but we’ve done nothing
else. In much of the rest of Europe we’ve got
bears, lynx and wolves coming back. If it works in
the rest of Europe, there’s absolutely no reason
why it can’t work in the UK,” he said. He added
that bears and wolves live less than an hour
away from Rome. “There’s no reason why we
can’t have a similar return of wildlife in the UK.”","“It is great to see this trend continuing but Britain
is completely anomalous – we’ve lost more of

turnaround from the centuries of persecution.”"
,"The survey found that the Eurasian lynx lives
permanently in 11 population groups in 23
European countries and only five of these were
native populations. This indicates the success
of reintroduction efforts. According to Monbiot,
support for the reintroduction of the lynx into the
Scottish mountains is growing.","The survey found the Eurasian lynx living
