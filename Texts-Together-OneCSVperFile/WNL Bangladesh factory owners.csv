"An international agreement to improve safety in
Bangladesh’s clothes factories could face legal
action. This is because factory owners are asking
for compensation for the cost of closures and
repair work. Some repairs may take months and
factory owners say they cannot pay workers while
factories are closed. Also, they cannot pay for
big works to make buildings safe. The building
repairs are happening after the Rana Plaza
building in the capital of Bangladesh, Dhaka,
collapsed in 2013 and 1,138 people died.","An international agreement to improve safety in

"The problems come as hundreds of Bangladeshi
clothes factories are inspected every month
for fire-safety and structural problems under
the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in
Bangladesh. The Accord is supported by over
170 international companies, including Primark
and Marks & Spencer, and international trade
unions, including IndustriALL.","The problems come as hundreds of Bangladeshi

"The owner of one Dhaka factory, Softex Cotton,
said he will take legal action against the Accord
because his factory was closed down as a result
of structural problems. He wants around $100
million in compensation.","The owner of one Dhaka-based factory, Softex

"Another factory owner said that, when a factory
closed, even for a few months, it would lose
orders and close permanently: “There is no
such thing as temporary closure,” he said. The
factory owner said it was not clear in the Accord
agreement who would pay for factory closures.","Another factory owner said that, once a factory

factory owner said that the Accord agreement

for factory closures because they just wanted to
get as many brands as possible to sign up to a
deal in the wake of the Rana Plaza disaster. He
said there was no clear process in place to pay
the costs involved.","Another factory owner, who declined to be

"Jenny Holdcroft, policy director for IndustriALL,
which has been closely involved in the Accord,
said that the agreement made sure that factories
would not lose orders during closure because
companies agreed to continue orders with
suppliers for two years.","Jenny Holdcroft, policy director for IndustriALL,

"The Accord has found12 factories that need a
lot of work, but Holdcroft said many of those
only needed partial closure and production could
continue on other floors. The Accord also asks
companies to make sure that workers receive
pay during factory closures. She said that
factory owners who could afford to pay for
repairs and compensation for workers should
make the payments.","Twelve factories have been identified by the
Accord as needing significant work so far, but

payments had been left open in order to ensure

"“Companies don’t want to pay so that rich factory
owners can continue to just take the profits and
not spend on their factories for years. It is not
surprising that there is disruption. If there was no
disruption, there would be no change,” she said.
A spokesman for the Accord said negotiations
over payments and even legal action would not
delay its work to improve safety in factories.","“This was always going to be a topic of
negotiation. Brands don’t want to commit to
paying so that rich factory owners who have just
pocketed the profits and not been spending on
their factories for years continue to do so. There
was obviously going to be disruption. If there
was no disruption, there would be no change,”
she said. A spokesman for the Accord said
negotiations over payments and even legal action
would not hold up its work to improve safety

"But there is now more pressure on the Accord
to help pay workers when their factories close.
A rival factory-safety group, supported by US
retailers including Walmart and Gap, the Alliance
for Bangladesh Worker Safety, has given $5
million to help pay factory workers for up to two
months while buildings are improved.","However, pressure on the Accord to contribute to
the payment of displaced workers has increased
after a rival factory-safety group, backed by US
retailers including Walmart and Gap, the Alliance
for Bangladesh Worker Safety, set aside $5m to
help pay factory workers for up to two months
while buildings are improved. It has, so far,
identified five factories in four buildings where
production needed to be suspended.","However, pressure on the Accord to contribute to

"“The Alliance is sharing the workers’ salary with
factory owners so now there is a big confusion.
We had a big meeting with the Accord to make
them understand they have to help or how
will we help our workers?” said Shaidullah
Azim, a director of the Bangladeshi Garment
Manufacturers and Exporters Association.","“The Alliance is sharing the workers’ salary
