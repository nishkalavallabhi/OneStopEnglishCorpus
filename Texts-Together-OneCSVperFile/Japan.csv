"Japanese entrepreneur Takahito Iguchi
thinks Google Glasses are not cool. He
may be right. There’s already a website
with pictures of people wearing them – the
people look ridiculous or smug or, more
often, both. If you search Google Images for
Google Glasses, one of the first pictures is
of a large, naked man wearing them in the
shower. Iguchi hopes that this is Google’s
weak point. He has designed some glasses
that are a bit more stylish and a bit
more Japanese.","The problem with Google Glasses, says

"Iguchi’s glasses aren’t really glasses – they
are a piece of metal with a camera and a
very small projector. The glasses are called
Telepathy One. Since he first presented
them to the public in Texas, they have
attracted $5 million from investors. Like
Glass, you will be able to buy Telepathy One
in 2014.","Iguchi’s augmented reality glasses aren’t

"It’s a more simple version of Google Glass.
Glass has many uses – you can surf the
internet, read emails, take photographs – but
Telepathy will be “more of a communication
machine”. Connected to your phone, it will
allow real-time visual and audio sharing.
You’ll be able to post photos and videos of
what you see on Facebook or send them
as an email. Or see and speak to a video
image of a friend.","It’s a simplified version of Google Glass. Glass

"“It will help bring you close to your friends
and family. We are very focused on the
communication and sharing possibilities,”
says Iguchi, who has worked in the
Japanese technology industry for 20 years.
“I’m a visionary,” he says. “I have a dream
that people will understand other people.
When I go to London, I am a stranger. But
I believe that everyone wants people to
understand them and to understand other
people. And, with the glasses, you can know
more information about people before you
even speak to them.”","“It will help bring you close to your friends

"When Iguchi was growing up, Japanese
technology ruled the world: they had the
Sony Walkman, which was as popular as
the iPhone. Now, to compete, he has had to
leave Tokyo and go to Silicon Valley. “Tokyo
is very rich in fashion and culture, but it’s
still an island. It’s isolated. There is no way
to expand. But, in Silicon Valley, everyone
is from everywhere. It’s where you come to
connect with the world.” They will make the
glasses in Japan and the software in the US.","Of course, not everyone wants to get closer
to the man in the futuristic headset, I tell him.
Iguchi shakes his head. “I’m a visionary. I
have a dream that people will understand
other people. When I go to London, I am a
stranger. Sometimes I feel fear. But I believe
that everyone wants to be understood and to
understand each other. And, with this device,
you can know more information about people
before you even speak to them.”","Of course, not everyone wants to get closer

"It was easy to build the prototype of
Telepathy One, Iguchi says. “We have
every sort of technology in Tokyo. The
problem is presenting it to the world.” The
top manufacturers all want to work with him,
he says, because they have the technology,
they just find it difficult to sell it. “There
needs to be a story to the product. Apple
had a story with the iPod – 1,000 songs in
your pocket. And Steve Jobs was inspired
by Akio Morita, the co-founder of Sony, and
he inspired me, so maybe it will come in
a circle.”","Compared to Google, Telepathy is a minnow,
but Iguchi doesn’t seem to worry. In his
shared office space in San Francisco – a cool,
converted warehouse – he quotes Sun Tzu’s
The Art of War and says that even tiny armies
can sometimes beat powerful forces. When he
was growing up, Japanese technology ruled
the world: the Sony Walkman was the iPhone
of its day. Now, to compete, he’s had to leave
Tokyo and go to Silicon Valley.","Compared to the likes of Google, of course,

even tiny armies can sometimes beat mighty
forces. When he was growing up, Japanese
technology ruled the world: the Sony Walkman

he’s had to quit Tokyo for Silicon Valley."
"Like Steve Jobs, Iguchi is a confident man,
but his strong Japanese accent makes it
difficult to understand him. It is possible
that this fact helped him to find the idea for
Telepathy One. When he visited London, he
stayed with someone he didn’t know. “He
was not my friend, but I talked with him for
three hours, and now he is my friend. That is
how long it takes to understand each other,
to share our feelings, and background, and
career. Maybe Telepathy makes that quicker.
If you are getting information from the cloud
and social networks, that will happen
more easily.”","“Tokyo is very rich in fashion and culture but
it’s still an island. It’s isolated. There is not any
way to expand. Whereas, in Silicon Valley,
everyone is from everywhere. It’s where you
come to connect globally.” The hardware will
be made in Japan, and he is putting together
a team of software engineers in the US to
develop its applications.","“Tokyo is very rich in fashion and culture but

wave of Japanese entrepreneurs being forced
to leave their homeland."
"Iguchi hopes that Telepathy One will help
people see other people’s point of view.
As a student, he explains, he studied
philosophy during the day and taught
himself how to code at night. “And, one day,
I opened the door of my apartment and I
suddenly realized that everything is code.
Everything is coded and can be shared
between humans. And everything can be
encoded and decoded. And, if code can be
exchanged between humans, that will end
all war.”","Building the prototype of Telepathy One

correspondent, Takashi Yanagisawa, tells
me. “And we need to find a way to regain our
power. Iguchi is kind of like the new frontier.
We hope he might be a new solution.” Building

Iguchi says. “We have every sort of technology

,"Maybe. He certainly has the confidence of
Jobs, but, with a thick Japanese accent,
he sometimes struggles to make himself
understood, a fact that may have contributed
to his idea for Telepathy One. When he went
to London to present the headset, he stayed
in an Airbnb. “The house owner was not my
friend but I talked with him for three hours,
and now he is my friend. That is how long it

them other people’s point of view.”"
