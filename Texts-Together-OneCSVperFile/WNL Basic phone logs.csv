"Two scientists at Stanford University, in the USA,
used metadata on people’s telephone calls and
texts to find out people’s names, where they lived
and the names of their partners. The metadata
told them what number people called, when and
for how long but it didn’t tell them what people
said.","The mass collection of telephone records by
government surveillance programmes poses a
threat to the personal privacy of ordinary people,
say US researchers. They used basic phone
logs to identify people and find out confidential
information about their lives.","The mass collection of telephone records by

"But, that was not all. With the same metadata,
they could find out private information about
some people. They discovered that one man had
a gun and that another man had a heart problem.
Other data told them that someone was having a
baby and someone had a serious illness.","With “metadata” on people’s calls and texts,

"The results show the extraordinary power of
telephone metadata. It is particularly powerful
when you use it together with information from
Google, Yelp and Facebook.","The same metadata led them to discover

sensitive information about some individuals.
One man was found to own a rifle, while
another had recently been diagnosed with an
irregular heartbeat. Other data pointed to a new

"Stewart Baker, who worked at the US National
Security Agency (NSA), said “Metadata tells you
everything about somebody’s life.”","The results show the extraordinary power of
telephone metadata – that is, the number called,
when and for how long – particularly when you
use it together with public information from
services such as Google, Yelp and Facebook.
Security services know how important this data
is. Stewart Baker, the former general counsel
at the US National Security Agency (NSA),
said “Metadata tells you everything about
somebody’s life.”","The results highlight the extraordinary power of
telephone metadata – the number called, when

of the data, which is not subject to the same
legal protections as the content of people’s
communications, has long been recognized
by the security services. As Stewart Baker,
the former general counsel at the US National
Security Agency (NSA), put it in the aftermath
of Edward Snowden’s revelations: “Metadata
absolutely tells you everything about somebody’s
life.”"
"Patrick Mutchler, a researcher at Stanford,
said that people who collect the information
understand the power of metadata but that the
public was in the dark.","Patrick Mutchler, a computer security researcher
at Stanford, said that the power of metadata was
understood by people who collect the information

difficult for people to fight these programmes.
Now, we have hard evidence we can point to that
we didn’t have in the past,” he said.","Patrick Mutchler, a computer security researcher
at Stanford, said that while the power of
metadata was understood by those gathering
the information, the public was largely in the dark

how rich the data is. “That makes it difficult

programmes to fight them. Now, we have hard
evidence we can point to that didn’t exist in the
past,” he said."
"For the study, 823 people agreed for researchers
to collect metadata from their phones using an
app. The app also received information from
their Facebook pages, which the scientists used
to check their results. The scientists collected
metadata on more than 250,000 calls and over
1.2 million texts.","For the study, 823 people agreed to have

"With very little money, Mutchler and Jonathan
Mayer found out a lot of personal information
about the people in the study. Some of the
information was private. They found out 82% of
people’s names. The same method gave them
the names of businesses the people called.
When they marked these on a map, they showed
groups of local businesses, which the scientists
guessed were near the person’s home address.
In this way, they named the city people lived in
57% of the time and were nearly 90% correct in
guessing, within 50 miles, where people lived.","Mutchler describes how, with very little money, he

metadata-gathering system were initially allowed
to examine data up to three hops away from
an individual. A call from the target individual’s
phone to another number was one hop. From that
phone to another was two hops. And so on. The
records available to analysts stretched back for
five years. The collection window has now been
restricted to two hops and 18 months at most."
"Then, the scientists used a simple computer
program to analyse people’s calls and this helped
them to see who was in a relationship. Once they
knew the owner of a particular phone number had
a partner, it was easy to find out who the partner
was, they said.","Then, using a simple computer program to

Academy of Sciences, Mutchler describes how,
on a shoestring budget, he and fellow graduate
student, Jonathan Mayer, uncovered a wealth

about people who took part in the study. Through
automatic and manual searches, they identified
82% of people’s names. The same technique
gave them the names of businesses the people

they revealed clusters of local businesses, which

home address. In this way, they named the city

90% accurate in placing people within 50 miles of
their home. Mutchler believes some of the misses
came from people not updating their Facebook
page when they moved out of their parents’
home, for example, to go to college."
"For the final part of the study, the researchers
looked even deeper to see what private
information they could get from telephone
metadata. They collected details on calls made to
and from places such as hospitals, pharmacies,
religious groups, legal services and gun shops.
From these, they produced interesting pictures of
people’s lives.","For the final part of the study, the researchers

territory. Using a simple computer program to
analyse people’s call patterns, they inferred who

easy, they report."
"Mutchler said the study showed how easy it is
to find out private information about people. He
says that the results should make governments
think twice before they record this information.
“Metadata programmes, like the NSA’s, will show
very private information about ordinary people,”
the scientists said.","One person in the study made frequent calls
to a local gun shop and later made long calls
to the customer support hotline of a major gun
manufacturer. The metadata from two others
suggested one had multiple sclerosis and the
other had just become pregnant.","For the final part of the study, the researchers
delved even deeper, to see what sensitive
information they could glean from telephone
metadata. They gathered details on calls made

services, firearms retailers and repair firms. From
these, they pieced together some extraordinary
vignettes from people’s lives."
,"“All of this shows what is possible with two
graduate students and limited resources,” said
Mutchler. He says that the results should make
policymakers think twice before allowing mass
surveillance programmes. “Metadata surveillance
programmes, like the NSA’s, will reveal highly
confidential information about ordinary people,”
the scientists said.","The metadata from one person in the study
showed they had a long call from a cardiology
centre, spoke briefly with a medical laboratory,
answered a number of short calls from a local
pharmacy and then made calls to a hotline
for abnormal heart-rate monitoring devices.
Another participant made frequent calls to a
local gun supplier that specialized in semiautomatic
rifles and later placed a number of
long calls to the customer support hotline run
by a major gun manufacturer that produced the
rifles. The metadata from two others suggested
one had multiple sclerosis and the other had
just become pregnant."
,,"“All of this should be taken as an indication of
what is possible with two graduate students and
limited resources,” said Mutchler, who argues
that the findings should make policymakers
think twice before authorizing mass surveillance
programmes. “Large-scale metadata surveillance
programmes, like the NSA’s, will necessarily
expose highly confidential information about
ordinary citizens,” the scientists write, adding: “To
strike an appropriate balance between national
security and civil liberties, future policymaking
must be informed by input from relevant
sciences.”"
,,"Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering
at Cambridge University, said the study provided
numbers that discussions can now be based
on. “With the right analytics running over nationscale
communications data, you can infer huge
amounts of sensitive information on everyone.
We always suspected that, of course, but here’s
the data.”"
