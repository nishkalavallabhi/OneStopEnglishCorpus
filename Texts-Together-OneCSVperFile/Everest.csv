"Mountain climber, Kenton Cool, has just
flown down from Everest base camp to
Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal. Cool is
talking about the three amazing climbs he
completed the previous weekend. Early on
Saturday morning, he reached the summit of
Nuptse, the first of the three main summits
in the Everest “horseshoe”. Later that day,
he climbed to the summit of Everest, and
reached the top in complete darkness early
on Sunday. He then continued to the summit
of Lhotse, the third of the three peaks, on
Monday morning.","Kenton Cool can hardly speak. All the physical
effort at high altitude has affected his voice.
He is now in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal
– he flew down from Everest base camp that
morning. Cool is talking about a startling
sequence of climbs completed the previous
weekend. Early on Saturday morning, he
reached the summit of Nuptse, the first and
lowest of the three main summits in the Everest
“horseshoe” that surrounds the glaciated valley
called the Western Cwm.","Unusually for someone who likes to chat,
Kenton Cool can barely speak. Exerting himself
at high altitude has left his voice a throaty growl.

"He says he took advantage of a rare
opportunity. “For the first time since the
late 1990s, there were fixed ropes on all
three mountains. What I did was still a great
physical achievement. But the person who
does it next will do it without ropes or
bottled oxygen.”","That same day, he climbed up to the summit
of Everest itself, reaching the top in complete
darkness early on Sunday. He and his climbing
partner then continued on to the summit of
Lhotse, the third of this spectacular three-peaks
challenge, on Monday morning.","That same day, he climbed up to the summit

"asked Cool to look forward and imagine
what top climbers might do 60 years from
now. “I hate to think,” he says, but he
mentions the Swiss climber, Ueli Steck,
who fled the mountain in April after an
argument with a group of Sherpas. Steck
was planning to climb Everest’s west ridge
and then immediately climb Lhotse via a
new route without fixed ropes. “Ueli trained
like a machine,” Cool says. “He’s a fantastic
climber. It would have been amazing.”","He says he took advantage of a rare
opportunity. “For the first time since the late

the physical achievement of what I did. I’ve set
the bar at a certain level. But whoever comes
along next will move the bar further and do it
without ropes or bottled oxygen.”","“It was a snatched opportunity,” he says. “For

"What will tourism look like in the Everest
region in the future? One clue is in the
amazing helicopter rescue by Simone Moro,
Steck’s climbing partner. Moro flew back to
Everest on Tuesday in a powerful helicopter
to rescue a climber at 7,800 metres.","Sixty years after Everest was first climbed,
many of the media reports are looking back
to Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay and
their age of innocence from the modern era of
commercialism and environmental damage.

"It was the highest rescue ever on Everest
and highlights the increase in helicopter
flights in recent years. By 2073, there might
be a helipad on the mountain that would
bring tourists. At the moment, they use
helicopters to rescue both climbers and
trekkers who walk to Everest
base camp.","“I hate to think,” he says, but mentions the
Swiss climber, Ueli Steck, who fled the
mountain in April after an argument with a
crowd of Sherpas at Camp 2. Steck, he says,
was planning to climb Everest’s west ridge, first
done in 1963, descend to the South Col and
then immediately climb Lhotse via a new route,
all without fixed ropes. “Ueli had been training
like a machine,” Cool says. “He’s a fantastic
climber. He’s technically brilliant but he had
also taken his physical condition to the highest
possible level. It would have been amazing to
see what he could have done.”","“I hate to think,” he says, but mentions the

“He’s a climber in a class all his own. He’s

"Mountain geographer and environmentalist,
Alton Byers, thinks it is not certain that
Everest can take more tourists. The
combination of climate change and tourism,
he says, is putting new pressure on the
area. Glaciers in the Everest region are
getting smaller, and even disappearing,
and this is having a big effect already.
“Everywhere you go, people are talking
about how there’s less water. There’s less
water for agriculture and less water for all
the new lodges that they are building.”","What will tourism look like in the Everest region
in the future? One clue is in the stunning
helicopter rescue by Simone Moro, Steck’s
climbing partner, whose rude language caused

"they are building a new pipeline to bring
water for the tourists. The local stream is
contaminated with human waste and does
not provide enough water for a place that is
full of tourists. “Every village is digging a pit
for garbage. Khumbu has the highest landfill
sites in the world,” he says. Human waste
is now taken away in plastic barrels but
then, according to Byers, these barrels are
emptied into a huge pit down the valley – it
could contaminate the region’s streams
and rivers.","It was the highest rescue ever performed
on Everest and highlights the huge rise in
helicopter flights in recent years. By 2073, the
infrastructure on the mountain might include
a helipad on the South Col that would bring
tourists. In the meantime, helicopters are
making it easier to rescue both climbers and
the far more numerous trekkers who go as far
as base camp.","It was the highest rescue yet performed on
Everest and highlights the exponential rise in
helicopter flights in recent years. By 2073, the
infrastructure on the mountain could include

are transforming the potential for rescuing both
climbers and the far more numerous trekkers
heading as far as base camp."
"“We can solve these problems, but we
need to be serious about it,” he says. “One
climber can spend $85,000 to climb Everest.
And that’s fine. But we’re going to have to
look at these other problems. For half a
million dollars a year, you could solve most
of them.”","It is not certain that the Everest region can
continue to cope with a booming tourism
sector, according to mountain geographer
and environmentalist, Alton Byers. The
combination of climate change and tourism, he
says, is creating new stresses on the Sherpa
homeland. The retreat, and in some cases
disappearance, of glaciers in the Everest
region is having a major impact already.
“Everywhere you go, people are talking about

"Climate change is another problem. Weather
patterns are changing and this is also
having an effect on tourism. Cloudy weather
is closing Lukla Airport, the entrance to
the Everest region, more often. They are
building a new road for 4x4s to Lukla, to
make sure tourists and their money can
reach Everest. But Byers is worried that
these new roads, which they are building
very quickly, could cause soil erosion
and landslides. He says that Everest is
the perfect place to study some of these
problems, like the effects of climate change
and tourism.","In the Sherpa town of Namche Bazaar, he
says, a new five-mile pipeline is being laid
to bring water to service the growing tourist
demand for showers and flush toilets. The local
stream has become contaminated with human
waste and does not provide enough water
for a place that, in high season, is bursting at
the seams. “Every village is digging a pit just
beyond the houses for garbage. Khumbu has
the highest landfill sites in the world,” he says.
Human waste at base camp is now managed
well and removed in plastic barrels. But,
according to Byers, these barrels are emptied
into a huge pit a few hours down the valley that
could leak into the region’s watercourses.","In the Sherpa town of Namche Bazaar, he says,

,"Climate change is another issue. Byers works
with local conservation committees to identify
and plan for the impacts of climate change,
most usually finding new water sources or
introducing rainwater harvesting. The rapid
build-up of glacial lakes is a constant threat
– they threaten to burst and flood the Sherpa
homeland. “At some point in the future, people
are going to have to get out of their way.”","Climate change is another matter. Byers works

,"Changing weather patterns are also having
an impact on tourism. Increased cloud
cover in periods of normally clear weather
is closing Lukla Airport, the gateway to the
Everest region, more often. A new road for
4x4s is being built to Lukla to guarantee the
flow of tourists and their money, but Byers
is worried that the rapid spread of the road
network in Nepal is being done too cheaply,
with disastrous consequences in terms of soil
erosion and landslides.","Changing weather patterns are also having
