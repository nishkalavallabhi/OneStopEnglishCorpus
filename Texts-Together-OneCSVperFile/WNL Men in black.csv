"Why do people want to be a football referee? The
top referees of the future smile when you ask
them this question. This season, more people
are criticizing referees. For this reason, some
former referees have started to complain about
standards. That is quite significant because,
when you talk to referees, it is obvious that they
always support each other.","Why do it? The elite football referees of the future

"So why do they do want to be referees? Why do
referees spend hundreds of hours driving around
the country? Why do they work so hard to get the
chance to make decisions on television in front
of millions of people who criticize them and their
ability with the help of many cameras and
slow-motion replays?","So why do they do it? Why spend hundreds of
hours driving up and down the country? Why
enforce rules, some of which inevitably upset
people? Why try to climb the ladder until you
get the chance to make decisions on television
in front of millions of people who scrutinize you
and your ability helped by many different camera
angles and slow-motion replays?","So why do it? Why spend countless hours driving
up and down the country to dole out rules, some

aid of umpteen different angles and

"You might get an answer from Lee Swabey’s
face. He looks really happy after he blows the
final whistle of a 2–1 win for Grimsby against
Woking, a match at level 5 of the English
league system. He gets what all referees want
every time they referee a match. “Twenty-two
handshakes,” he explains afterwards, proudly.
“The buzz,” as he calls it, of a game that goes
well, is something he loves. “I wouldn’t spend so
much time away from my family if this wasn’t so
important to me.”","You might get an answer from the face of Lee

"Swabey is one of a group of new referees that
the Professional Game Match Officials Limited
(PGMOL) thinks is really good. So Swabey
knew they were watching him at that match.
PGMOL’s chief, Mike Riley, was there, and also
his colleague Steve Dunn, watching every move
the officials made.","Swabey is one of a group of referees that is

with notes and stopwatch to catalogue every
significant move the officials make."
"A few weeks earlier, Riley, Dunn and another
former referee, Peter Jones, went to another
level-5 match to check another young referee –
John Brooks. “I hope to have the opportunity to
work in the Premier League and referee at some
of the top games in this country,” Brooks says.","A few weeks earlier, Riley, Dunn and another

this country,” Brooks says."
"Unfortunately, the PGMOL only saw Brooks
cancelling the match because of a frozen pitch. It
is all part of the experience Brooks needs to have
before he can referee at more important games.
Brooks phoned his coach for advice and made
the difficult but correct decision. A little later, the
football club secretary arrived to pay the officials
for their time – the match fee at level 5 is £95 so
it is clear that these men do not do it for
the money.","Unfortunately, all the PGMOL delegation saw was
the way Brooks handled the difficult situation of
cancelling the match because of a frozen pitch.
It is all part of the experience Brooks needs to
acquire before he is trusted with more important
games, the different problems that need dealing
with – often, clubs are very reluctant to have a
late postponement, particularly when they have
to pay all the staff who have come but will not
receive any gate money.","The most the PGMOL delegation got to observe,

"Brooks, like Swabey, has clear ambitions to
progress. He knows lots of people will criticize
him. How does he feel when he watches football
on TV and a referee is attacked? “Erm … I don’t
feel great,” he admits. “I do sometimes wish
people understood the time and effort we put in.
It is very easy to criticize a decision but we do
everything to try to get these decisions right. In
certain situations, you are going to be unpopular
but, if you are uncomfortable with that, you are
probably in the wrong job.”","Brooks phoned his coach for advice and made

"The former referees agree that the backup,
education and tools that today’s referees have is
very different from what they experienced in the
past. Riley, as a young referee, bought himself
books on psychology and nutrition because there
was no information on offer to him at all.","Brooks, like Swabey, has clear ambitions
to progress. He knows that dealing with
disappointments is a big part of that. How does
he feel watching football on TV when a referee

a thick skin and perfecting strategies to deal with

been in that situation once where I have made an
incorrect decision and it was a deciding goal that
was just offside. Your heart sinks. You can’t stop
thinking about it."
"Things are very different for Brooks – he has his
own coach. They talk every week, discuss how
his games have gone, study film of key decisions
and discuss how to improve. He also has the
support of a sports psychologist and an exercise
regime to help him run 11km during a game.","The former referees agree that the backup,

"The three former referees all agree that new
technology in the sport is great. “It makes the
referee’s job better and makes them more
effective on the field of play,” says Riley. A bad
decision can stay with you for a while. “The rest
of your life,” says Jones with a laugh.","Contrast this with Brooks, who has a coach he
can call. They consult weekly, discuss how his
games have gone, study footage of key decisions

him handle the 11km he runs during a game.","The former referees agree that the backup,

him at all."
,"Brooks says psychology is vital in his
development. “One of the things we have talked
about is forgetting decisions and moving on,” he
explains. “There may be a big decision to make in
the first 30 seconds of the game. Once you have
made that, you need to stay focused for the next
89 minutes and not be wondering whether that
was correct or worrying about that decision. Liam
has taught us some techniques for forgetting that
decision. Working with the sports psychologist is
really important for mental toughness.”","The former referees agree that the backup,

help. “I refereed in professional football but,
looking back, I was an amateur,” he says.
“I was going to work – I worked for British
Telecom – and I might referee at Newcastle on a
Wednesday evening and, 9am the next morning,
I was in Leicester trying to speak to customers.
I perhaps hadn’t slept. Training was ad hoc. We
were amateurs in a professional environment
