"Six years later, in the summer of 2011,

"Fewer and fewer people want BlackBerry
phones. There are now many alternative
products, from Facebook’s and Apple’s
instant messaging applications to
independent apps such as WhatsApp and
Kik (which is also Canadian). They are free
to download and use, and they use the
internet to swap text messages, pictures,
voice clips, ‘stickers’ and even videos

"BBM is trying to keep its customers and you
can now use it on Android and Apple phones.
There are many other apps people can use,
but lots of people want to use the BBM app
– more than 20 million people downloaded
it. But many people believe BBM will not
survive. “The move to bring BlackBerry to
the iPhone is four or five years too late,”
says James Gooderson, a technology
blogger. “WhatsApp has made BlackBerrys
unnecessary for young people.”","In an attempt to keep its customers, BBM has
been released on Android and Apple phones.
Despite the competition from other apps, the

save the service. “The move to bring BlackBerry

"BBM says it has 80 million monthly users
after its upgrade, but WhatsApp has
300 million. Other services show BBM’s
weaknesses: Skype and Viber have video
or voice calls, but BBM doesn’t; Path does
location sharing, but BBM doesn’t; there is
no video sharing, as on iMessage; and the
stickers (a more sophisticated version of
the smiley face), that kids around the world
adore, are also absent. Even the contacts

"Messaging is now becoming visual. Photos
that are uploaded to Instagram get instant
comments and Snapchat’s pictures have
opened a world of other possibilities. Like
BBM, all of these services are free for any
phone with an internet connection. But, in
2011, BBM was so powerful that it helped to
start a revolution in Egypt; and at the time of
the London riots, people used BBM, not their
televisions, to find out quickly what
was happening.","Messaging is moving from verbal to visual.

"Nearly 80% of young smartphone owners
regularly use a social networking application
but two-thirds use more than one. 60% of
16- to 24-year-olds use Facebook every day,

media specialist. “All of these apps use your

would catch up four hours later,” said Jean-
Pierre Moore, 28. He manages a youth club in
Stockwell, south London, an area with some of
the highest levels of crime and poverty in Britain.
Moore mainly communicates on an iPad now. He
does not agree with the idea that a shutdown of
BBM would have stopped the looting. “The social
networking wasn’t the reason,” he says.","“We could see on our BlackBerry messages
