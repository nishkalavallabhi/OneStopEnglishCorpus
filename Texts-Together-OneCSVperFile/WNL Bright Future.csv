"On the top of a hill, above Northumberland’s
beautiful Kielder Water lake, a group of people
are waiting in a car park next to a strange
wooden building. They are here because of the
darkness and this is Kielder Observatory, the
centre of Britain’s latest industry – astrotourism.
The people who are waiting outside are lucky.
Many more people apply for a night of stargazing
at the observatory but not everyone can come
because numbers are strictly limited.","On the top of a hill, looking down on

"Inside, the observatory’s founder and lead
astronomer, Gary Fildes, speaks to his
colleagues and volunteers. The team discusses
that they might see the northern lights but Fildes
doesn’t think they will. Instead, they decide to
use their powerful telescopes to look at Jupiter
and Venus and, later, to find stars such as
Capella and Betelgeuse. An extra attraction is the
appearance of the International Space Station.","Inside, under a dim light, the observatory’s

"Fildes is a leading figure in the UK’s growing
astrotourism industry. The key moment for
Northumberland came in 2013 when the entire
national park, about 1,500 square kilometres in
area, got Dark Sky Park status. It is the only one
in England. Dark Sky Parks are rare. Research in
2013 showed that only 5% of the UK population
can see more than 31 stars on a clear night.","Fildes, 49, is at the forefront of the UK’s growing

interaction, it’s about entertainment, it’s about
inspiring people.” He puts on some music. Pink
Floyd, the Jam, the Pogues. “By 9.30, the sky is
going to be sexy,” Fildes says. “It’s going to
be epic.”"
"The International Dark-Sky Association (IDA)
gives the status of Dark Sky Park only to places
that take big steps to prevent light pollution. The
areas must also prove their night skies are very
dark. In Northumberland Dark Sky Park, it is so
dark that Venus casts a shadow on the Earth.","The Arizona-based International Dark-Sky
Association (IDA) awards the status of Dark

"Duncan Wise, visitor development officer for the
Northumberland National Park, helped to lead the
campaign for dark-sky status. “We usually think
that ‘landscape’ is everything up to the horizon,”
Wise said. “But what about what’s above the
horizon?” Wise and others spent years preparing
their application to the IDA – they collected
thousands of light readings.","Duncan Wise, visitor development officer for

"Because of their hard work, many of the 1.5
million tourists who visit Northumberland each
year are now aware of its Dark Sky status. “A lot
of people come here to see the sky now,” says
a man who works for a local car-hire company.
“They come in autumn and winter, when it’s
darkest. It’s good for the local hotels because
tourists come all year round now.”","Their efforts have been rewarded. Many of the

others spent years drawing up their submission
to the IDA, collecting reams of light readings
and forming an alliance of local councils, parks’
bodies and community groups to produce an
exterior lighting master plan that influences the
construction of new developments in the area."
"Wise agrees that Northumberland needs to do
more to take advantage of its dark skies, which
are very rare. He believes the region needs
more observatories to make sure that visitors
will see what they came for. A new £14-million
national landscape discovery centre will have an
observatory when it is completed in a couple
of years.","Wise agrees that Northumberland needs to do

"Fildes has big ambitions. He is planning
Britain’s first “astrovillage” – it would have
the largest public observatory in the world, a
100-seat auditorium, a 100-seat planetarium,
and radiomagnetic and solar telescopes. The
multimillion-pound project would also have a
hotel and attract 100,000 visitors a year – that is
four times the number that are currently able to
use the observatory.","Fildes has big ambitions. He is planning Britain’s

"However, Northumberland has competition.
Galloway Forest Park in Scotland also has Dark
Sky Park status. Exmoor in south-west England
became Europe’s first International Dark Sky
Reserve – one level below Dark Sky Park – in
2011. A number of local businesses there now
offer stargazing holidays. The UK is not as good
as northern Chile, which has more than ten
tourist observatories and some of the clearest
skies in the world.","However, Northumberland has competition.

"So, why do people want to look at the night sky?
The media have helped. TV programmes about
astronomy have attracted a new generation of
stargazers. Technology has also made astronomy
more popular. Apps such as Stellarium now turn
smartphones into pocket-size planetariums. But
Fildes believes that, most importantly, people are
starting to appreciate the sky. “If you had to build
a visitor attraction from the beginning, what could
be better than the universe?”","So, why do people want to look up into the night
