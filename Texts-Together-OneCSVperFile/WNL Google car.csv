"Google has begun testing the electric car at its
headquarters in Mountain View, California. The
car does not have all the normal car controls,
such as foot pedals. Instead, it has a smartphone
app that calls it and tells it the destination, and a
STOP button between the two seats in case the
passengers need to override the computer.","The electrically powered vehicle, which Google

"The company is building about 100 prototypes
for a two-year test. The company’s co-founder,
Sergey Brin, said that the vehicle was still just
a prototype. He says that they want to change

"Google says that the aim of the project is to
improve safety. They say that the car is made
with foam at the front and a plastic windscreen,
so “it should be far safer than any other car

"The cars have been built specially by a company
in Detroit. Google will now test the cars, which
are not yet for sale.","Google says that the aim of the project is to

"There need to be detailed scans of the roads
before the cars can drive on them, because they
cannot collect and process enough information in
real time.","The cars, which have been built specially by an
unnamed company in Detroit, will be used to find
out how best to make driverless vehicles work.

miles of California’s roads, but California has
more than 170,000 miles of roads.","One challenge is creating high-definition scans of

"But Chris Urmson, director of the driverless car
project at Google, said that the new prototypes
do not have a steering wheel or brakes because
a human passenger might not be able to take
control in an emergency. He said that it was
simpler just to have an emergency stop button.","Other car makers, including Volvo, Ford and

of the 10,500-strong London Taxi Drivers’
Association, said: “You won’t get these driverless
cars in London for 20 or 25 years. Maybe, by
then, they’ll have a charge point – because there
isn’t a single one in London now.”"
"Urmson said: “The vehicles will be very basic.

the push of a button. And, that’s an important
step towards improving road safety and helping
millions of people travel around more easily.”","But Chris Urmson, director of the self-driving car
