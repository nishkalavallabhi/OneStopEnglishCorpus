"Chemists have waited a long time to find a new
element and, now, researchers in Japan, Russia
and the US have discovered four. The four new
elements will be added to the periodic table. They
are the first elements to be added since 2011,
when elements 114 and 116 were included. The

"The International Union of Pure and Applied
Chemistry (IUPAC) is the global organization
that controls chemical names. IUPAC confirmed
the new elements on 30 December, 2015. The
scientists who found them must now think of
formal names for the elements, which have the
atomic numbers, 113, 115, 117, and 118. The
atomic number is the number of protons in an
element’s atomic nucleus.","The US-based International Union of Pure
and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the global
organization that controls chemical names,
terminology and measurement, verified the
elements on 30 December, 2015 after examining
studies dating back to 2004. The scientists
who found them must now come up with formal
names to replace the Latin-based temporary
names – ununtrium, ununpentium, ununseptium
and ununoctium – which reflect their atomic
numbers, 113, 115, 117, and 118. The atomic
number is the number of protons found in an

"IUPAC said that a Russian-American team
of scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear
Research in Dubna and Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory in California had discovered
elements 115, 117 and 118. The organization
said a team of scientists from the RIKEN Institute
in Japan discovered element 113. The decision
means Japan becomes the first Asian country
to name an element. Under IUPAC rules, new
elements can be named after mythological
concepts, minerals, a place or country, or
a scientist.","IUPAC announced that a Russian-American

"In 2012, scientists chose the formal name
flerovium for element 114, after the Flerov Lab
at Dubna’s Joint Institute of Research. And they
chose the formal name livermorium for element
116, after the Lawrence Livermore Lab in the US.
The elements were discovered there. Kosuke
Morita, who led the research at RIKEN, said his
team now planned to “look to element 119 and
beyond”. Jan Reedijk of IUPAC said: “Chemists
want to see the periodic table finally completed
down to the seventh row.”","When elements 114 and 116 were given formal

"The Japanese team is considering three
names for element 113: japonium, rikenium
and nishinarium, after the Nishina Center for
Accelerator-Based Science, where they found the
element. Polly Arnold, professor of chemistry at
Edinburgh University, said, “This is very difficult
and slow work. The work helps us understand
radioactive decay. If we understand it better,
hopefully we can find a better way to deal with
nuclear waste and things that are important in the
real world. And, when they build the equipment to
make these discoveries, it also leads to fantastic
improvements in technology.”","The Japanese team is considering three

"Scientists must find new names for the elements
but, also, they must suggest two-letter symbols
for the elements. When IUPAC has received the
researchers’ suggestions, they will tell the public
so that people can comment on the names. That
allows scientists and others to find any problems
with the names. In 1996, someone suggested
the symbol Cp for copernicium, or element
112, but it was changed to Cn, when scientists
complained that Cp was already the symbol for
another substance.","Along with new names, the scientists must
suggest two-letter symbols for the elements.
When IUPAC has received the researchers’
suggestions, they will go to public review for
five months. That allows scientists and others to

"To discover the elements, researchers at the
three labs crashed lighter nuclei into one another
and looked for the radioactive decays that should
come from the new elements. 113 and 115 are
probably metals. 117 could be a metalloid – a
material with some metallic characteristics. The
fourth element, 118, may be a gas.","To discover the elements, researchers at the

Ununseptium could be a metalloid. The fourth
element, ununoctium, may be a gas, like other
elements, helium, neon and argon. It is hard to
know for sure because so few atoms of each
element have ever been made.","To discover the elements, researchers at the

elements have long enough lifetimes for their
detailed chemistry to be explored. Practical
applications of the new elements, if any, are a
long way off because of the difficulty
in synthesis.”"
