The company, Mars One, plans to send four

up a human colony in 2023. But there are a
couple of serious problems.","A few months before he died, Carl Sagan
recorded a message of hope to would-be Mars
explorers, telling them: “Whatever the reason
you’re on Mars is, I’m glad you’re there. And I
wish I was with you.”"
"Firstly, on Mars the astronauts’ bodies
will have to adapt to gravity that is 38%
of gravity on Earth. This would probably
cause such a total change in their bones,
muscles and circulation that the astronauts
would no longer be able to survive on Earth.
Secondly, they will have to say goodbye to
all their family and friends, because there is
no return ticket.","Firstly, when on Mars the astronauts’ bodies
will have to adapt to surface gravity that is
38% of that on Earth. It is thought that this
would cause such a total change in their bone
density, muscle strength and circulation that
the astronauts would no longer be able to
survive in Earth’s conditions. Secondly, and
directly related to the first, they will have to
say goodbye to all their family and friends, as
there is no return ticket.","Seventeen years after the pioneering astronomer
set out his hopeful vision of the future in 1996, a
company from the Netherlands is proposing to
turn Sagan’s dreams of reaching Mars into reality.
The company, Mars One, plans to send four
astronauts on a trip to the Red Planet to set up a
human colony in 2023. But there are a couple of
serious snags."
"The Mars One website says that the
astronauts cannot expect to return. To
return, they would need a rocket that can
leave Mars. The rocket would need life
support systems for a seven-month journey
and would need to either join up with a
space station or land safely on Earth.","The Mars One website states that a return
“cannot be anticipated nor expected”. To
return, they would need a fully built rocket
with enough fuel for the return journey, which
is able to escape the gravitational field of
Mars, and has on-board life support systems
for a seven-month trip. And they must be able
to link up with a space station orbiting Earth
or perform a safe re-entry and landing.","Firstly, when on Mars their bodies will have to

family and friends, as the deal doesn’t include a
return ticket."
"But the project has already had 10,000
applicants, according to the company’s
Medical Director, Norbert Kraft. He told The
Guardian that the applicants so far were
aged 18 to at least 62 and, although they
include women, they were mostly men.","Nevertheless, the project has already

He told The Guardian that the applicants so
far ranged in age from 18 to at least 62 and,

mostly men.","The Mars One website states that a return
“cannot be anticipated nor expected”. To return,
they would need a fully assembled and fuelled
rocket capable of escaping the gravitational field
of Mars, on-board life support systems capable
of up to a seven-month voyage and the capacity
either to dock with a space station orbiting Earth
or perform a safe re-entry and landing."
"Mars One says that the astronauts must be
resilient, adaptable, curious, trusting and
resourceful. They must also be over 18.","The reasons they gave for wanting to go were
varied, he said. An American woman called
Cynthia, who gave her age as 32, said that it
was a childhood dream of hers to go to Mars.","“Not one of these is a small endeavour,” the site
notes, requiring “substantial technical capacity,
weight and cost”."
"Mars One says that the basic things people
need to live are already present on the
planet. For example, they can take water
from ice in the soil and Mars has sources of
nitrogen, the primary element in the air we
breathe. The colony will use solar panels to
get power, it says.","She told the project: “When I first heard
about the Mars One project I thought, this
is my chance – that childhood dream could
become a reality. I could be one of the
pioneers, building the first colony on Mars and
teaching people back home that there are still
uncharted territories that humans can
reach for.”","Nevertheless, the project has already had 10,000
applicants, according to the company’s Medical
Director, Norbert Kraft. He told The Guardian that
the applicants so far ranged in age from 18 to at
least 62 and, though they include women, they
tended to be men."
"The project will cost around $6 billion.
Some of this money could come from TV
broadcasting rights. “The money made
broadcasting the London Olympics was
almost enough to pay for a mission to Mars,”
Bas Lansdorp, the company’s founder, said.","The main attributes Mars One is looking for in
astronaut-settlers are resilience, adaptability,
curiosity, ability to trust and resourcefulness,
according to Kraft. They must also be over 18.","The reasons they gave for wanting to go were
varied, he said. An American woman called
Cynthia, who gave her age as 32, told the
company that it was a “childhood imagining”
of hers to go to Mars. She described a trip her
mother had taken her on in the early 1990s to a
lecture at the University of Wisconsin."
"Another person who supports the project
is Paul Römer, one of the creators of Big
Brother, one of the first and most successful
reality TV shows. “This mission to Mars
could be the biggest media event in the
world,” said Römer. “A reality show and a
talent show, with no ending and the whole
world watching.”","Mars One says that the basic things required
for life are already present on the planet. For
instance, water can be taken from ice in the
soil and Mars has sources of nitrogen, the
primary element in the air we breathe. The
colony will be powered by specially adapted
solar panels, it says.","She said the lecturer had been Sagan and she
had asked him if he thought humans would land
on Mars in her lifetime. Cynthia said: “He in turn
asked me if I wanted to be trapped in a ‘tin can
spacecraft’ for the two years it would take to get
there. I told him ‘yes’, he smiled, and told me in
all seriousness, that yes, he absolutely believed
that humans would reach Mars in my lifetime.”"
"Mars One wants to build a permanent
human colony, according to its website.
The first team would land on Mars in 2023
to begin building the colony, and a team of
four astronauts would arrive every two years
after that.","The project will cost a reported $6bn, and
Bas Lansdorp, the founder of Mars One, has
said he hopes this money will be collected
partly by selling broadcasting rights. “The
broadcasting revenue from the London
Olympics was almost enough to finance a
mission to Mars,” Lansdorp said.","She told the project: “When I first heard about
the Mars One project I thought, this is my chance
– that childhood dream could become a reality.
I could be one of the pioneers, building the first
settlement on Mars and teaching people back
home that there are still uncharted territories that

"But some people are sceptical of the project,
and some people are worried about how
astronauts might get to the planet and build
a colony with all the life support and other
things they need.","Another ambassador to the project is Paul

"The mission hopes to inspire people to
“believe that all things are possible, that you
can achieve anything,” like the Apollo
moon landings.","The aim is to establish a permanent human
colony, according to Mars One’s website.
The first team would land on Mars in 2023 to
begin building the colony, with a team of four
astronauts every two years after that.","Founded in 2010 by Bas Lansdorp, an engineer,
Mars One says it has developed a realistic road
map and financing plan for the project based
on existing technologies and that the mission
is perfectly feasible. The website states that
the basic elements required for life are already
present on the planet. For instance, water can
be extracted from ice in the soil and Mars has
sources of nitrogen, the primary element in the
air we breathe. The colony will be powered by
specially adapted solar panels, it says."
"“Mars One believes it is not only possible
but necessary that we build a permanent
colony on Mars so that we can improve
our understanding of the solar system, the
origins of life, and our place in the universe,”
it says.","The project has its sceptics, however, and
people are worried about how astronauts
might get to the planet and build a colony
with all the life support and other
requirements needed.","Mars One said it had signed a contract with the
American firm Paragon Space Development
Corporation to take the first steps in developing
the life support system and spacesuits fit for
the mission."

Prize for theoretical physics in 1999, is an
ambassador for the project. ‘T Hooft admits there
are unknown health risks. The radiation is “of
quite a different nature” from anything that has
been tested on Earth, he said."
