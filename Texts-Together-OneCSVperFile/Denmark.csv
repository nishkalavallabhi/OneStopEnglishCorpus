"Emmanuel Limal wanted to find love on
online dating sites but he was tired of
meeting women who said that they weren’t
ready to start a family. The 43-year-old

Copenhagen for 20 years. He was looking
for love and wanted to start a family. He tried
to find someone online but without success.","Emmanuel Limal used online dating sites a

"“Everyone said that they were really active,
always travelling or with a long list of
hobbies, but they didn’t talk about children,”
Limal said. “On some sites, there was an
option to click saying: ‘I’d like kids someday,’
but I read the person’s profile and thought:
‘You will never have time!’ If someone’s
going to the gym eight times a week and
travelling every month, they are not putting a
family first.”","“I got frustrated with everyone saying they

"Limal has a six-year-old daughter from an
old relationship but he has always wanted
more children. “I couldn’t meet anyone
who wanted to start a family”. He said it
was difficult to know when to talk about
wanting kids when he met someone new.
“It’s a difficult subject to talk about when
you are on a date,” he said. “Then one day
I read a profile from a 38-year-old who said
she knew it was ‘really bad to admit’ but
she wanted children. And I thought: ‘You
shouldn’t be ashamed of this.’”","Limal has a six-year-old daughter from a
previous relationship, but coming from a
big family – his father is one of 11 – he has
always wanted more children. “I couldn’t
seem to meet anyone willing to prioritize
starting a family”. He said it was difficult to
know when to mention wanting kids when
he met someone new. “It’s the ultimate
dating taboo,” he said. “Then one day I read
a profile from a 38-year-old who said she
knew it was ‘really bad to admit’ but she

"Limal borrowed money to start
Babyklar.nu – or ‘baby-ready now’ in
English. It works like a normal dating site
but everyone is asked to be honest about
their wish to start a family soon. “We ask
people if they are OK with someone who
already has children and if they want
another baby,” Limal said. “But we don’t
make them say how many children they
would like. That would be like food
shopping online.”","Limal borrowed money to pay for the setting

"He has had a very positive response to
the site. “Fifty people signed up every hour
when we started in June. There are already
couples who met through the site and are
now together. I think we will have the first
Babyklar.nu baby by next summer.” More
men have signed up than women (53% to
47%), with comments such as “I can finally
be honest about what I want.”","He has had a very positive response to the

"The site has come at the right time for the
country of five million people. Danes are not
having enough children and the current rate
of 1.7 children per family means that the
population is falling. The usual reasons are
given – women are leaving it “too late” and
couples are living together without getting
married and waiting to start families.","The site has come at the right time for the

"“Now, I hope, men and women who want
to start a family but haven’t met the right
person yet will have another choice,” says
Limal. He says that this isn’t just about
making babies: “I want this to be about
children and love. My goal is to bring
together people who really want a family and
a partner – and who’ll stay together. I’m
a romantic.”","“Now, I hope, men and women who want

"He is planning to start sites in France and
the UK later in 2013, but at the moment the
only site is in Denmark. “Danes have no
problem having children before marriage
so things can move fast and, because the
country’s so small, someone from Jutland
can date someone from Copenhagen
without too much travel,” Limal said. And
Limal has finally found love. “I’ve met a nice
woman and she wants a baby too – so we
shall see.”","There are plans to launch the site in France
