"Not many exercise classes have a tea break
in the middle. But Margaret Allen’s class has
one. After a gentle warm-up and a few quick
exercises, the 93-year-old
great-grandmother lets her group sit down
and relax with a cup of tea. Some of the
eight people in the class look like they need
a break, but Allen is not even sweating.","Not many exercise classes have a tea break

"The general rule is that eating just before
doing sport is not a good idea and especially
not halfway through the class. But, on the
afternoon I visit Allen’s class in Saltburnby-
the-Sea, they eat fruitcake during the
break. The cake was made for Allen’s recent
birthday by her 89-year-old sister, Joan.","Some of the class of eight look as if they need
to rest more than others. Allen herself, wearing
a thick shirt, knitted waistcoat, slacks and
sensible shoes, is not even sweating. Despite
an extremely painful trapped nerve in one leg
and a knee in need of replacement, she looks
like she could go on for hours.","Some of the eight-strong class look as if
they need it more than others. Allen herself,

waistcoat, black slacks and sensible shoes,
has not broken into a sweat. Despite an
“excruciating” trapped nerve in one leg and
a knee in need of replacement, she looks as
though she could go on for hours."
"The ladies have just finished their cake
when Allen gets up again. She plays a
lively Scottish song and there is lots of toe
pointing and leg kicking. Forty-five minutes
later, the class is finally over.","The general rule is that eating just before

Joan, known locally as the “scone queen
of Saltburn”."
"Allen has been leading classes in the
north-east town for 45 years. She wasn’t
very sporty at school, but she started playing
the piano for a keep-fit class during the
second world war and started leading the
class in her 40s when the old instructor retired.","The ladies have just finished their cake when
Allen is up again, leading the group through a
lively Scottish tune with lots of toe pointing and
leg kicking. Forty-five minutes later, the class is
finally over.","The ladies have barely swallowed their last
crumb when Allen is up again, leading the
group through a jaunty Scottish number
involving lots of toe pointing and leg kicking.

finally over."
"At one time, Allen’s class had more than 18
regulars, each paying £1 a time. But, these
days, the group is getting smaller. During
the tea break, the ladies discuss a funeral
that most of them went to that week for one
of the younger people in the group who died
recently, aged 68.","Allen, a former volunteer with the charity Red
Cross, has been leading classes in the

blackouts, really” – and eventually took over in

"Allen is the oldest, her sister the second
oldest. The baby of the group is
60-year-old Jean Cunion, who is a bit
embarrassed to say that she is perhaps
the least fit of the group. “I remember, the
first time I came, Margaret said, ‘Who’s that
breathing heavily?’ and I had to say it was
me.” Ruth Steere, 76, says Allen always has
her back to the class, but she always knows
what’s happening: “She always shouts at us
if we go wrong. She’s very good at knowing
what we are doing.”","At one time, Allen’s class had more than 18

neurone disease."
"Allen, who loves dancing, has never done
any formal training to be a fitness instructor.
Instead, she got ideas for her own moves
from five fitness videos from the BBC. Allen
thinks she is healthy because she keeps
busy, especially since her husband died in
1997. She started writing poetry when she
was 80.","Allen is the oldest, followed by her sister. The
baby of the group is 60-year-old Jean Cunion,
who is a bit embarrassed to admit that she is
perhaps the least fit of the group. “I remember,
the first time I came, Margaret said, ‘Who’s that
huffing and panting?’ and I had to admit it was
me.” Ruth Steere, 76, says Allen always knows
what’s going on, although her back is always
to the class: “She always shouts at us if we
go wrong. She’s remarkably good at knowing
what we are doing.”","Allen is the oldest, followed by her sister. The

"“I write poems about everything. I just can’t
stop,” she says, when she phones me a
few days after the interview to read out
a poem she has written about the joys of
exercise. She still plays the piano and gives
speeches. She also did a computer course
when she was 88.","Allen, a keen dancer, has never done any
formal training to be a fitness instructor.

fitness guru, Eileen Fowler. Allen thinks her

"Ageing is no fun, she says. She reads me
a few lines from a poem she has written
called ‘That Beast Called Age’. She happily
remembers a doctor who saw her for the
first time a few years ago, who said he
didn’t believe she was more than 78: “I said,
‘Thank you, doctor. You can go now.’”","“I write poems about everything. I’m a prolific
writer. I just can’t stop,” she says, when she
phones me a few days after the interview to
read out a poem she has written about the
joys of exercise. One of the class, 84-year-old
former teacher Winnie Robertson, thinks the
secret to staying fit is never letting yourself go:
“Use it or lose it, that’s what I say.”","“I write poems about everything. I’m a prolific

"She also has a practical idea for people who
are overweight: “I just think people shouldn’t
eat too much. When I hear someone say,
‘Oh, I can’t lose weight’, I say: ‘Sellotape.’”
She mimes taping her mouth shut. “I
said this the other day to a big fat man.
Everything in moderation is my motto.”","Allen still plays the piano and gives speeches.

"Earlier in 2013, Allen was watching the news
and saw a woman get the British Empire
Medal. “The woman said: ‘I’m 80 and I’m
the oldest fitness instructor in the country!’
I thought: ‘No, you’re not.’” But Allen won’t
write to the Queen to complain.","She also has a no-nonsense attitude to weight
