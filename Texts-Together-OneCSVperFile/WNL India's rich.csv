"Economic growth has been weak in recent years
in India. The cost of basic foods has risen and
the value of the Indian currency has fallen. The
economy has not been good but there are now
nearly a sixth more Indians with more than $3.75
million than in 2013, the report says. “Cities are
mushrooming, the middle class is growing, there
are lots more opportunities and Indian politics
have improved a lot in recent months,” according
to Murali Balaraman, a co-author of the report.","Recent years have seen weak economic growth,
rising prices of basic foods and a fall in the value

"New rich people are buying lots of luxury things.
“They really want to show or talk about their
wealth and buying luxury things is a nice way
to do it,” Balaraman said. Abhay Gupta, who
works for the company Luxury Connect, said that
more and more people will want to buy luxury
things and experiences. “There is a huge class of
people who want to copy very wealthy people,”
he said.","A booming luxury market is serving the new rich.

"Cars are very popular things to buy, the report
says. In 2009, wealthy Indians bought Indian

"But companies sell fewer luxury cars because of
India’s terrible transport system. Lamborghini’s
Chief Executive, Stephan Winkelmann, said,
in 2013, that the traffic and roads in India “are
not so suitable” for the $450,000 sports cars. In
India, Lamborghini sells two models: the Gallardo
and the Aventador, which has a maximum
speed of 217 miles per hour. Winkelmann said
Lamborghini’s Indian customers were much
younger than European customers. In India, a
normal buyer is in his 30s. But the most popular
investments are still houses – mainly in India –
and jewellery.","India’s appalling infrastructure limits demand

"But people who buy luxury things are becoming
more and more difficult to satisfy, the report says.
One super-rich person bought nine boxes of
Japanese whisky that cost more than over $750

the imported whisky was that no one who came

identical pairs of Louis Vuitton bags, then cut up
half of them to make clothes that would match
her bags.","But buyers of exclusive luxury goods are
