"Poorer countries will be most affected
by climate change in the next century.
Sea levels will rise, there will be stronger
cyclones, warmer days and nights, more
rainfall, and larger and longer heatwaves,
says a new report.","Low-income countries will continue to be
the most affected by human-induced climate
change over the next century. They will
experience gradual sea-level rises, stronger
cyclones, warmer days and nights, more
unpredictable rainfall, and larger and longer
heatwaves, according to a recent report.","Low-income countries will remain on the front
line of human-induced climate change over the
next century, experiencing gradual sea-level

"The last big United Nations (UN) report, in
2007, said there would be temperature rises
of 6 °C or more by the end of the century.
Scientists now think this will not happen,
but average land and sea temperatures will
probably continue rising during this century,
possibly becoming 4 °C hotter than now.
That rise would ruin crops and make life in
many cities too hot.","The last major United Nations (UN)
assessment, in 2007, predicted temperature
rises of 6 °C or more by the end of the
century. That is now thought unlikely
by scientists, but average land and sea

throughout this century, possibly reaching
4 °C above present levels – enough to
devastate crops and make life in many cities
unbearably hot.","The last major United Nations (UN)

"As temperatures rise and oceans become
warmer, there will be big changes in annual
rainfall in tropical and subtropical regions,
says the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) report, released in
Stockholm and published online
in September 2013.","As temperatures rise and oceans warm,

"East Africa can expect more short rainfalls
and west Africa should expect heavier
monsoons. Burma, Bangladesh and India
can expect stronger cyclones; elsewhere in
southern Asia, there will probably be heavier
summer rainfalls. Indonesia may receive
less rainfall between July and October, but
the coastal regions around the south China
Sea and Gulf of Thailand can expect more
rainfall when cyclones hit the land.","East Africa can expect increased short

"‘Rainfall patterns will change. Northern
countries, for example in Europe or North
America, will probably receive more rainfall,
but many subtropical, dry regions will likely
get less rain,’ said the report.","“In the long term, rainfall patterns will
change. Northern countries, such as those
in Europe or North America, are expected to
receive more rainfall, but many subtropical
arid and semi-arid regions will likely
experience less rain,” said the
report’s authors.","“It is virtually certain that, in the long term,
global precipitation will change. High latitude
countries, such as in Europe or North America,
are expected to receive more rainfall, but many
subtropical arid and semi-arid regions will likely
experience less precipitation. Over wet tropical
regions, extreme precipitation events will very
likely be more intense and more frequent in a
warmer world,” said the report’s authors."
"The report also said that the monsoon
season will probably start earlier and
last longer.","They added that the monsoon season is
likely to start earlier and last longer.","They added: “Monsoon onset dates are likely
to become earlier or not to change much while
monsoon withdrawal rates are very likely to
delay, resulting in a lengthening of the season.”"
"Scientists in developing countries are happy
with the report. “The IPCC says that climate
change is real and happening much more
strongly than before. We are already seeing
the effects of climate change in Bangladesh
and across south Asia. It’s not news to us.
Most developing countries are experiencing
climate change now. They do not need
the IPCC to tell them that the weather is
changing,” said Saleemul Huq, director of
the International Centre for Climate Change
and Development.","Scientists in developing countries and
commentators have welcomed the report,
which they said supported their
own observations.","Scientists in developing countries and

"Scientists have also lowered their

warmer world, the report says. The number
of tropical cyclones will probably not change,

stronger winds and heavier rainfall.","Scientists have also lowered their

"Life in many developing country cities could
become very diffi cult, especially because
city temperatures are already higher than
those in the countryside. Much higher
temperatures could reduce the length of the

"The charity Oxfam said that world hunger
would get worse because climate changes
hurt crop production. They said the number
