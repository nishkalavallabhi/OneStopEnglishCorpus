"It is difficult to know exactly where the
noise is coming from, but you can hear
it everywhere in Damascus. All day and
all night you can hear the sound of guns,
rockets or planes attacking rebels – the
sound of war is getting closer to Syria’s
capital. The Syrian war began two years ago
and now the people of Damascus try not to
listen to the sound of explosions just a few
miles away.","It is hard to tell exactly where the noise is coming
from, but impossible to miss it from anywhere
in Damascus. All day and all night you can hear
the sound of guns, rockets or planes attacking
rebel positions – the sound of war getting closer
to Syria’s capital. Just over two years after the
Syrian crisis began, the people of Damascus
have learnt to ignore the sound of death and
destruction just a few miles away.","It is hard to tell exactly where the noise is coming
from, but impossible to miss it from anywhere
in Damascus: all day and night you can hear
the dull thud and boom of artillery, rockets or
planes pounding rebel positions – the sound of
war getting closer to Syria’s capital. But just over
two years into the Syrian crisis – the longest
and bloodiest of the Arab uprisings – ignoring
the sound of death and destruction nearby has
become the new normal for Damascenes."
"“Actually you get used to it after a while,”
said George, who lives in the city. “But you
never know exactly what they are hitting.”
That usually becomes clear later from videos
that the opposition puts on YouTube.","“Actually you do get used to it after a while,”
said George, an IT technician. “But you never
know exactly what they are hitting.” That usually
becomes clear later from video clips posted by
the opposition on YouTube.","Over the weekend, men could be seen puffing
on water pipes in a palm-shaded park, children
playing between the flowerbeds and couples
chatting on benches as the unmistakable
thunderclap of high explosive could be heard
a few miles away – smoke rising between the
minarets of a nearby Ottoman-era mosque. No
one seemed to notice."
"The constant noise of bombs is more
worrying because the government tries so
hard to pretend that life is normal. “As you
can see, everything here is fine but we have
to hit the terrorists, these extremists,” an
army officer said. One government official
said: “If I was afraid, I would just shut my
door and stay inside. I have to work and I
am not afraid. If I don’t defend my country,
who will?”","The constant background noise is more worrying
because the government tries so hard to keep an
atmosphere of business as usual. “As you can

was afraid, I would just shut my door and stay

George, an IT technician from a village on the
coast. “But you never know exactly what they are

"In private conversation, ordinary people say
something different. In the centre of town, a
shopkeeper complained sadly that his baby
daughter cries at the sound of explosions.
Zeina, a student, worries that she has
learnt to live with suffering and danger. “In
the beginning, when there started to be
explosions, I used to have nightmares,” she
said. “Now I can sleep through anything.”","In private conversation, ordinary people are less
defiant. In the centre of town, a shopkeeper
complained sadly that his baby daughter cries
at the sound of explosions. Zeina, a twentysomething
student, is afraid she might become
desensitized to suffering – and perhaps to danger
too. “In the beginning, when there started to
be explosions, I used to have nightmares,” she
reflected. “Now I can sleep through anything.”","The sinister background noise is doubly
disturbing because the government tries so hard
to preserve a jaunty air of business as usual. “As
you can see, everything here is fine but we have
to hit the terrorists, these extremists,” an army
officer announced. An official, whose route home
has come under attack from rebels in Daraya,
said: “If I was afraid, I would just shut my door
and stay inside. I have to work and I am not
afraid. If I don’t defend my country, who will?”"
"And, the dangers are increasing even closer
to home. Sabaa Bahrat Square was the
safest part of Damascus, but recently a car
bomb exploded there and damaged the
Syrian Central Bank. The square is often
used for pro-government rallies, with people
shouting slogans under enormous pictures
of President Bashar al-Assad.","And, the risks are increasing even closer to
home. In Sabaa Bahrat Square, in what was
supposed to be the safest part of Damascus, a
car bomb exploded, leaving the front of a building
black, its windows broken and also damaging the
imposing structure of the Syrian Central Bank
next door. The square is often used for televised
pro-regime rallies, with people chanting slogans
under giant banners of President Bashar al-Assad.","Ordinary citizens, in private conversation, are

"That bombing was not the worst one in
Damascus in recent months. In February,
reports say that 80 people, including
schoolchildren, died near the ruling Ba’ath
Party headquarters in Mazraa. You can still
see the crater. “I live nearby but
luckily I wasn’t there,” says Munir, a
university lecturer.","That bombing was not the worst Damascus has
experienced as the situation has deteriorated. In
February, reports say that 80 people, including

asphalt on the main road going north. “I live
nearby but luckily I wasn’t there,” recalled Munir,
a university lecturer.","And, the risks are multiplying even closer to
home. In Sabaa Bahrat Square, in what was

structure of the Syrian Central Bank next door."
"Rebels, who are now very close to the city,
have recently started to fire mortar bombs.
The bombs killed 15 students in a university
cafeteria on 28 March. They probably
wanted to hit a government building.","Mortar bombs, fired from rebel-held areas now
very close to the city, have become a worrying
new development. The bombs killed 15 students
in a university cafeteria on 28 March. The intended
target was probably a government building.","Mourning notices for two of the 15 victims –
Muhammad al-Sufi and Manal al-Tahan – are
stuck to the wall opposite. Scruffy, machine-gun
toting militiamen mill around the square, often
used for televised pro-regime rallies with civil
servants bussed in en masse to chant slogans
under giant banners of President Bashar
al-Assad."
"In July 2012, a bomb killed four of Assad’s
senior aides. After that, security increased.
Concrete barriers – often painted in the
Syrian flag’s black, red and white – now
protect official buildings, not just the military
or defence installations that are
obvious targets.","There has been increased security since the
bombing of the national security crisis cell in
July 2012, when four of Assad’s most senior
aides were killed. Concrete blast barriers – often
painted in the Syrian flag’s black, red and white –

or defence installations that are obvious targets.
The Iranian Embassy in Mezze now looks like
a fortress. “The regime did manage to set up a
ring of steel round Damascus,” a foreign diplomat
said. He added that there are now holes in that
ring of steel and that brings home the reality of
the war.","That bombing was not the worst Damascus has
experienced as the situation has deteriorated. In

"Moving around the city has become difficult
and takes a lot of time – another part of life
today in a nervous city. Checkpoints on main
roads stop traffic for ID checks and bags are
searched for explosives. Only drivers with
official permission can use special fast lanes
to avoid the wait.","All this means that moving around has become
difficult, unpredictable and time-consuming –
another part of life today in an understandably
nervous city. Checkpoints on main roads stop traffic
for ID checks and baggage searches with handheld
explosive detectors – vital to stop future bombers.

use special fast lanes to avoid the wait.","Mortar bombs, fired from rebel-held areas now
within easy range of the city, have become an
ominous novelty. The bombs killed 15 students

"There is one question on everyone’s mind:
will there be a battle for Damascus – one of
the world’s oldest cities – like the one that
has badly damaged Aleppo? One view is
that there will be a battle for Syria’s capital,
but not yet – in the summer perhaps. Others
argue that there will probably not be a
complete victory for either side and hope for
a political solution that comes from abroad.
But most people here do not expect things
to get better.","It is hard, however, to avoid the question on
everyone’s mind: will there be a battle for
Damascus – the world’s oldest continually
inhabited city, as the guidebooks say – like the
one that has so damaged Aleppo? Parts of
the city already feel like a war zone: its most
exclusive and expensive hotel is almost empty,
although many rooms are being used as offices
by international agencies with white UN vehicles
parked behind the blast barriers outside. The
streets empty soon after 9pm.","Security measures have intensified since the
devastating bombing of the national security
crisis cell in July 2012, when four of Assad’s

its turquoise mosaic front giving an exotic glimpse
of Isfahan or Shiraz, looks like a fortress. “The
regime did manage to set up a ring of steel round
Damascus,” a foreign diplomat said. “But for
whatever reason the perimeter is starting to be
punctured and that brings home the reality of

,"One view is that the fight for Syria’s capital
