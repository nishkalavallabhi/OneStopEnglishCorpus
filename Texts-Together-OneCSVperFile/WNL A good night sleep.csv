"Not sleeping very much used to be a sign that

"Businesses have realized that they can make

of businesses are interested in where, when and
how we sleep and, also, how much we will pay
for it. Luxury hotels give people “sleep retreats”;
more than $1,000 gets you dinner and a movie
about sleep. And, if you’re staying home, you can
improve your bedroom with a mattress cover with
a sensor that monitors your sleep ($249) or a
sleeping mask that monitors your brainwaves and

"Sleep has not only become big business – it
has also changed companies. Many companies
already have sleeping areas and Huffington
says that nap rooms in offices will become “as
common as conference rooms” in the next two
years. So, how did this happen? How did sleep
suddenly become so fashionable?","Sleep has not only become big business – it

"Many people these days find it normal to pay $10
for green juice and $34 for an indoor cycle class.
And these people have made getting enough
sleep a part of their lifestyle. Our bodies have
become machines that we monitor for better
efficiency and sleep is now another set of data for
us to follow. Huffington does not say that sleep
rests you; she says it restores you. Sleep is now
an important status symbol for some people.","Many people these days find it normal to pay $10

And getting enough sleep fits into this kind of
lifestyle. Then, there’s wearable technology. Our
bodies have become machines that we monitor
and optimize for greater efficiency and sleep has
become another data set to be monitored. What
Huffington emphasizes about sleep, after all, is
not that it rests you but that it restores you. Sleep,
she says, is the ultimate performance enhancer
and getting eight hours of rest has become the
ultimate status symbol.","Getting enough sleep is a natural fit for the sort

"But, it is not always easy to get enough sleep;
you have to go to bed in the right neighbourhood
and in the right body. Many studies show that
you’re more likely to sleep badly if you’re poor. It’s
hard to sleep if you’re worried about your safety
or haven’t had enough to eat. It’s hard to sleep if
you’re one of the 15 million Americans who work
irregular hours. Research has also found that
there’s a black/white sleep gap. One study shows
that white people sleep an average of 6.85 hours
but African Americans only sleep an average of
6.05 hours. They also have a lower quality
of sleep.","You know how Arianna Huffington gets her eight
hours? Well, she has “nine or so” assistants.
Huffington calls them her “A-Team”. They do
everything for her. They run her errands, plan
her travel and load The Huffington Post on her
computer in the morning. According to the New
York Times, most of the A-Team can only survive
about 12 months in the job because it’s so taxing.
The low pay also means many of them take
second jobs. Basically, they don’t sleep so that
Huffington can … and can sell books about it.","You know how Arianna Huffington gets her eight

"Do you know who gets the most sleep and the
best quality of sleep in America? Rich white
women. And, they are probably the people
Huffington wrote her book for. Huffington
describes her ideas about sleep as a “revolution”
but, in fact, it’s a rebranding. The real problem
with sleep isn’t that a few rich people think it’s
a waste of time; the problem is that 99% can’t
afford to spend time sleeping.","Getting enough sleep isn’t just a question of

"Sleep may make you perform better but it’s an
inefficient way to improve your performance.
The real prize is finding a way that humans
can work on less sleep. It is no surprise that
the US military is researching this. In 2008, the
Pentagon published a report called “Human
Performance” which examined the possibility of
a future in which soldiers could perform at their
best with only a couple of hours’ sleep. “Imagine
that you could make a human who slept for the
same amount of time as a giraffe (1.9 hours per
night). This would reduce the number of deaths
and injuries. An enemy would need 40% more
soldiers to be able to fight us.”","Do you know who gets the most sleep and the
best quality of sleep in America? Rich white
women. Who are probably the same people
Huffington wrote her book for. Huffington

but, really, it’s a rebranding. The very real sleep
crisis isn’t that a few rich people think it’s a waste

face isn’t down to a few rich people thinking it’s a

to afford to spend time sleeping."
"One day, humans will find a way to remove the
need to sleep completely. Spending a third of
your life asleep won’t be a luxury anymore; it will
be something only the poor will have to do. Then,
we may need a whole new sort of

ampakines, a class of drugs that modulate
neurotransmitters in the brain, to remove the
effects of sleep deprivation."
