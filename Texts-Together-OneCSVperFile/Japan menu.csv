a request to add Japanese cuisine to its cultural
heritage list.","Even the government’s top spokesman,

could “harm the credibility of brand Japan,

,"The industry’s biggest problem will come from
Japan’s demanding consumers. In 2009, 72%

labelling law due to go into effect in 2015. The
authorities’ only legal weapon is a law banning
misleading representations of goods
and services."

discerning and demanding consumers. In a 2009
poll conducted by an online restaurant guide,
72% of respondents said provenance was the
most important factor in selecting
dishes from a menu, followed by calorific and
nutritional details."
