The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have won the first part of their fight for privacy. A French magazine was told to stop selling or reusing photos of the royal couple. The pictures show the duchess sunbathing topless while on holiday in the south of France. 
It is possible that the magazine editor and the photographer or photographers will also have to go to a criminal court. 
The French magazine Closer was told to give digital files of the pictures to the couple within 24 hours. 
Closer’s publisher, Mondadori Magazines France, was also told to pay €2,000 in legal costs. The magazine will have to pay €10,000 for every day it does not give the couple the files. 
The court decided that every time Mondadori – the publishing company owned by the ex Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi – publishes a photograph in the future in France, they will get €10,000 fine. 
The couple welcome the judge’s decision. “They always believed the law was broken and that they had a right to their privacy.” 
The royal couple are pleased with the decision, but they want to have a much more public criminal trial against the magazine and photographer or photographers. 
Under French law, if you do not respect someone’s privacy, you may have to spend a maximum of one year in prison and pay a fine of €45,000. 
This punishment would send a message to the world and, the couple hope, stop paparazzi taking photos like this in the future. 
On Saturday the Irish Daily Star also published the photos. And the Italian celebrity magazine Chi published a special edition of 26 pages with the photos of the future queen.
