On one day in August, one in seven people on Earth, 1 billion people, used Facebook, according to founder Mark Zuckerberg. In ten years, the social network has completely changed people’s relationships, privacy, their businesses, news media, helped to end regimes and even changed the meanings of common words.
“A more open and connected world is a better world.
It brings stronger relationships with those you love, a stronger economy with more opportunities and a stronger society,” wrote Zuckerberg.
These are just some of the ways his company changed everything – for better or worse.
1 Facebook has changed the definition of “friend”
“To friend” is now a verb. And, unlike in real life, it is easy to “unfriend” someone, a word invented to describe ending a Facebook friendship when that person is no longer improving your Facebook newsfeed.
Although the meanings of the words “share” and “like” are basically the same, Facebook has made the terms more important to us.
School and university reunions are unnecessary – you already know whose career is going well, whether the perfect pair have split and you’ve seen pictures of your schoolmates’ babies. You won’t be surprised to see an ex in the street with a new girlfriend or boyfriend: you already know they’re dating someone else from the romantic selfies.
But, unlike in real life, on Facebook, all your friends have the same importance. A classmate from university who you haven’t seen for 15 years, a friend-of-a-friend from a party or a colleague you’ve never actually spoken to in person – they are all Facebook friends in the same way as your closest friend or your spouse or your mum.
It doesn’t necessarily mean we see them the same way. Professor Robin Dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have about 150 people as a social group. Facebook hasn’t changed that yet, he believes. But Dunbar says he fears it is so easy simply to end friendships on Facebook that, eventually, people may not need to learn to get on with each other.
2 We care less about privacy
The surprising thing is that Facebook users happily hand over their information.
Pew Research Center found that most young people are more than willing to hand over their details. Ninetyone per cent post a photo of themselves, 71% post the city or town where they live, more than half give email addresses and a fifth give their phone number.
But, because so much of a person’s life is shared online, Facebook gives people a way to create an image and a fanbase. Academics have described a new phenomenon: the “Facebook self”.
More than 80% of Facebook users list their interests, which allows brands to target them effectively. But most younger users limit who can see their profiles, with 60% allowing friends only.
3 Facebook has created millions of jobs – but not in its own offices
Facebook provides indirect employment for people whose job it is to make Facebook work for their brand.
“It is a tool like no other,” said Michael Tinmouth, a social media strategist who has worked with brands such as Vodafone and Microsoft. “Marketers have an understanding of a brand’s customers like they have never had before. The data available is extraordinary. You know who your customers are, who they are friends with and how they engage with your brand.” And advertisers pay a lot for that. Facebook reported advertising revenue had increased by 46%, reaching $3.32bn.
Facebook is also a minefield for brands. Suddenly, customers don’t simply complain on the phone to a customer service representative or on a small specialist internet forum – angry customers can post their complaints for hundreds of their friends to see or even on the brand’s own page.
4 Facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions
Organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by Facebook. Manchester University’s Olga Onuch found Facebook had been the key way for reaching half of all the Euromaidan protesters in Ukraine.
Many of the people interviewed in Onuch’s research said they relied on Facebook for the truth about what was happening – they don’t trust traditional media.
5 Facebook makes news, breaks news and decides what is news
About 71% of 18- to 24-year-olds say the internet is their main news source and 63% of users overall, according to the Pew Research Center. About a third of Facebook users post about politics and government.
Most people will first read an item of breaking news via Facebook or other social media, mostly on mobiles.
Facebook has also changed the ways journalists write stories. It is a resource many reporters cannot now live without. For better or (often) worse, it is a place to find information on almost any ordinary person, who might suddenly find themselves at the centre of the day’s biggest news story.
6 Users are changing Facebook
It used to be a site for students of top US universities.
In 2014, ten years after its launch, 56% of internet users aged 65 and older have a Facebook account.
And 39% are connected to people they have never met in person.
More than ever, the site is a gateway not just to your friends but to the rest of the internet.
We may as well get used to it, said David Kirkpatrick, author of The Facebook Effect. “It might very well go away further down the road but something this big takes a long time to disappear,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “Facebook has proven its ability to change and it will continue to be a very, very major player.”
