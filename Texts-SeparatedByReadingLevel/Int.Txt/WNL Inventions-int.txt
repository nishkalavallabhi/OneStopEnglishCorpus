1 Flappy Bird
Be careful what you wish for, especially if you want to invent something new. Recently, Dong Nguyen, the designer of the mobile game Flappy Bird, removed it from app stores. He said its success – it had been downloaded more than 50 million times and was making him around £30,000 from advertising each day – had ruined his simple life. On his Twitter account, he said: “I cannot take this anymore.”
OK, so regretting making Flappy Bird isn’t quite the same as regretting making a rifl e, but Nguyen is just the latest inventor who wished he hadn’t created a monster.
2 The labradoodle
The labradoodle isn’t a monster – it’s adorable. But what’s monstrous is the way crossbreed dogs have been sold since the labradoodle’s inventor, Wally Conron, fi rst created the breed in the 1980s. “I’ve done a lot of damage,” he told the Associated Press. “I’ve created a lot of problems. There are a lot of unhealthy and abandoned dogs out there.” Conron came up with the labradoodle when he was working for the Royal Guide Dog Association of Australia to provide a dog for a blind woman whose husband was allergic to dog hair. What he didn’t expect was that the labradoodle – and other types of poodle-cross dogs, many of which have health problems – would become so popular.
3 The AK-47
Six months before his death in December 2013, Mikhail Kalashnikov, the designer of the assault rifl e, wrote to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church: “My spiritual torment is unbearable. If my rifl e killed people, does that mean that I, Mikhail Kalashnikov, 93 years of age, the son of a poor farmer, Christian and Orthodox by faith, am responsible for people’s deaths, even if they were enemies?”
4 Electronic tagging
The electronic tag was originally made in the 1960s as a way of tracking former prisoners’ attendance at school and work, and rewarding them for good behaviour. Its inventors, Bob Gable and his brother Kirkland, were later horrifi ed that the tag had become a form of control and punishment. “It’s not pleasant,” Kirkland Gable told the Guardian in 2010, “but I’m not in control of the universe. I have to realize there are some things out of my control.”
5 Pepper spray
After police sprayed peaceful protesters with pepper spray at a University of California campus in 2011, one of the scientists who helped develop it in the 80s denounced its use.
“I have never seen such an inappropriate use of chemicals,” Kamran Loghman told The New York Times.
6 The offi ce cubicle
In the late 60s, a new form of offi ce was designed to give workers privacy and increase productivity by providing more work space.
Instead, it became a way for companies to put employees into tighter spaces. These days, the cubicle is often connected with uniformity and soulless work. Its inventor, Bob Propst, said, in 1997, “the use of cubicles in modern corporations is crazy.”
